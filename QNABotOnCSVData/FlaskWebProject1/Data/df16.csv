57,"Trade discounts, rebates and other similar items are deducted in determining the cost of purchase. Trade discounts, rebates and other similar items are deducted in determining the cost of purchase.| The revenue from the sale of scrap, by-product has to be posted as a credit in Direct Variable Cost (DVC) Material account.|"
59,"In case the scrap/waste of costly raw material such as copper, silver is significant at the entity level, it is recommended to establish the| standard cost of the products net of revenues coming from the resale of copper/silver scrap/waste/ by-product.|"
60,"In this situation, the entity has to book in its balance sheet an inventory for these scrap/waste material at their probable realizable| value and for internal control purposes it is mandatory that all in and out flows related to this inventory are followed and controlled.|"
61,A dedicated reference product for scrap material has to be created in the local ERP in order to manage such Inventories . |
64,At components level internal logistic costs (inbound reception of components in a factory) such as:|
65,"warehouse area (rental or depreciation, utilities)| Personnel costs labour (handling, picking, quality control),| handling equipment (forklifts, small tool).|"
66,"Must be included in the standard cost of the sub-assemblies and manufactured products. Consequently, these costs are not included| in components inventory valuation.|"
67,"However, as a transition period until systems are adapted accordingly, entities can include them in the valuation of the stock of| components instead of the standard cost of the sub-assemblies /manufactured products. Be careful, for Group accounts theses costs| shall not be taken twice in the cost of Inventories .|"
69,"The amount to be recognized is the price in local currency on the transaction date, i.e. the date of initial inventory recognition. For| practical reasons, the Group uses :|"
70,- either the average exchange rate for the month as an approximation|
71,- or a fixed exchange rate as standard for the whole year (in this case any difference must be adjusted at the end of the year).|
72,"When Inventories are purchased in foreign currencies, the effects of changes in exchange rates may be covered by appropriate| hedges. Variances generated by these hedge operations should be included in inventory valuation.|"
76,The cost of all Inventories produced or adapted by the Group includes:|
77,the cost of purchase of materials and supplies as defined above; and| the cost of conversion.|
78,"The costs of conversion of Inventories include costs directly related to the units of production, such as direct labour. They also include a| systematic allocation of fixed and Variable production overheads that are incurred in converting materials into finished goods.|"
79,"Costs directly related to the units of production are presented as direct variable costs, and Fixed production overheads are presented as| manufacturing base costs.|"

In that case manufacturing process is not over and| freight expenses have to be included in the inventory valuation.|"
83,"Freight expenses stop being included in inventory valuation if no value is added between two transfers, as an example between a plant| and a distribution centre except when delivering parts to a DC for product adaptation.|"
84,Direct variable costs are allocated to each unit of production on the basis of the actual expenses incurred. |

89,"For entities being pure factories without any other activity (no direct sales) such as global factories, these departments and functions| usually devote their entire activity to manufacturing. Therefore, all related costs are to be included in conversion costs. For other entities,| an allocation of these costs shall be done.|"

Depreciation of these intangibles is included in conversion costs, through a central adjustment made| by consolidation team.| Other development costs are incurred for Quality (Quality & Value Engineering process) and Product adaptation. These costs are| not capitalized as separate projects, they are reported as gross margin by the entities but are allocated to inventory cost through| a central adjustment made by consolidation team.|"
97,"The allocation of manufacturing base costs to the costs of conversion is based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. Normal| capacity is the production expected to be achieved on average over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances, taking| into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance.|"
98,The amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is not increased as a consequence of low production or idle plant.| Unallocated overheads are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.|
99,"In periods of abnormally high production, the amount of fixed overheads allocated to each unit of production is decreased so that| Inventories are not measured above cost.|"
101,"This section applies to all types of Inventories, either purchased or produced by Schneider Electric entities. Examples of costs excluded| from the cost of Inventories and recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred are:|"
102,"Abnormal amounts of wasted materials, labour or other production costs. :|"
103,"These costs include all waste, scrap, non quality costs that are unplanned meaning not included in the Bill of material| and/ or Produce operating time as defined for the product reference.| By default these amounts should be booked in DVC Material except when there is a provision that has been booked in| DVC Other. In order to be consistent, reversal of provision and associated costs have to be booked also in DVC Other| (examples of situations where a provision is booked: natural disaster, stock cleansing for obsolescence, product| substitution between old and new range)|"
104,Certification costs incurred by a manufacturing entity| Storage costs unless those costs are necessary in the production process before further production stage. As a result:|
105,"Storage costs incurred by plants because they need to store raw materials and semi-finished goods awaiting use in the| production process are included in the costs of Inventories.| Storage costs incurred by distribution centres are excluded from the costs of Inventories, as goods stored in distribution| centres are mainly finished goods for which the production process is complete.|"
106,Administrative overheads that do not contribute to bringing Inventories to their present location and condition.

116,"When establishing technical data for a product (quantities of materials and subassemblies, time necessary for production) and making| the corresponding investment, decision made (Investment Authorization) will take into account projected sales to determine the objective| of capacity of the production line. Thus, the time scheduled for an item corresponds to the resources necessary to produce this item.|"
117,"Production volumes are attributed to factories taking into account their production capacity, and the objective of the manufacturing| direction is to adapt as much as possible the capacity of the factory to attributed volumes. |"
118,"If the factory is unable to adapt the capacity in case of a decrease in volumes, then the return of the assembly line decreases, and this| shall not result in an increase in manufacturing base costs allocated to Inventories.|"
119,The same conclusion must be reached when the factory encounters major quality problems that have a consequence on productivity.|
121,"In case of temporary under-activity, plant management is responsible to take necessary actions to adapt manufacturing structure costs| as much as possible.|"
122,In this situation restatement of Inventory valuation is forbidden as action plan implemented shall allow getting rapidly a normal capacity| of production.|
123,"However, due to the economic situation or due to a specific local context, some manufacturing entities may face an important decrease| of their industrial volumes.|"
124,Entities will have to document this under-activity situation and detail the short term action plan they commit to implement until an| adjusted capacity of production is reached.|
125,"Based on a case by case analysis, GSC Finance (Region + Central) and Consolidation Director will decide the appropriate| restatements of inventory valuation to be booked.|"

130,Variances observed between actual expenses and standard costs are allocated to Inventories if material and should be analyzed at least| for each half-year reporting.|
131,"Variances related to direct variable costs are allocated to Inventories, except for abnormal amounts of wasted materials, labour or other| direct variable costs.|"
132,The treatment of variances related to manufacturing base costs depends on their nature:|
133,"Variances due to changes in costs shall be allocated to Inventories (such as salary increase, maintenance costs increase).| Variances due to an abnormally high production shall be allocated to Inventories so Inventories are not measured above cost.| Variances due to a decrease in the return of the assembly line operating below normal shall not be allocated to Inventories.|"
134,"Within the Group and depending on the local ERP, cost of inventory in manufacturing entities can be based:|"
135,on actual costing| on standard cost that is revised on a regularly basis| on standard cost that is calculated in year N-1 during standard cost campaign|
138,"Product purchased from an intra-group supplier attached to another legal entity. There is no inventory valuation adjustment for| this product as the inventory is valued with the transfer price set once a year. In case IG purchase price is set in a foreign| currency with a fixed exchange rate as standard for entire year, inventory valuation shall be adjusted with forex purchase price| variance at year end.| WIP & Finished products stored by the manufacturing plant. The variances between actual costs and standard costs must be| measured and reintegrated in inventory valuation if significant. In case of inventory valuation based on standard costs calculated| in year N-1, inventory at end of year N should be adjusted based on last standard cost calculated in year N.|"
141,"Distributed products ""made to inventory"": the inventory is composed of a large number of similar items that are ordinarily| interchangeable. For those goods, the cost of Inventories shall be assigned by using the weighted average cost formula. Under| this cost formula, the cost of each item is determined from the weighted average of the cost of similar items at the beginning of a| period and the cost of similar items purchased or produced during the period.|"
143,"The unit price is the average of total stock amount by total stock quantity. For example, a company purchases ten cases of widgets at| the cost of $70 per case in January while the stock quantity is zero.|"
144,"The MAP after this purchase is $70. The company purchases fifteen cases of the same type of widgets cost $80 per case in March.| The stock quantity before the second purchase was five cases. The actual stock valuation is $1,550 which is equal to (5 x 70) + (15 x| 80) and the new MAP becomes $77.5 which is equal to ((1,550) / (5 + 15)). For the next production order requiring the use of this type| of widget, the new MAP ($77.5) will use. |"
145,"Goods and systems ""made to order"": the inventory is composed of segregated items related to specific projects. For those| goods, the cost of Inventories shall be assigned by using specific identification of their individual costs. These Inventories would| generally be produced for a specific contract.|"

151,"For finished goods, NRV corresponds to the estimated selling price of such goods less costs necessary to make the sale.| For work in progress, NRV is determined as the estimated selling price of the corresponding finished good less costs of| conversion and other necessary to complete the production process and costs necessary to make the sale.| For raw material, NRV approach does not apply since these materials are used in a further production stage. The| obsolescence analysis applies to raw material. |"

201,"Based on Group transfer pricing policy, manufacturing plants selling their products to intra group entities and Front offices buying their| products from intra group entities should not have in their balance sheet Inventories which cost is lower than the net selling price.|"
202,"When applicable, this test shall be performed by comparing at entity level the cost of inventory with the estimated net selling price.

362,"To ensure that the physical quantities are in line with the administrative quantities and values on the system,| To avoid the stock out situations.|"
363,It is critical to have an anticipated physical inventory approach that allows to:|
364,"Identify stock differences and update the stock in the system,| Investigate differences and close any gaps in other operational processes that cause the variance| Notify the relevant managers of their variance figures and to highlight various problem areas within the various material| categories.|"
365,A physical inventory requires preparation and temporary shutdown of operations. Inventory counting must work in harmony with| warehouse activity and material movements.|
367,"The full inventory is a process that attempts to maintain the accuracy of the book to actual inventory quantities and response to the| reporting purposes. At this time in particular, the accounting department calculates the annual cost of goods sold and the inventory| adjustment throughout the fiscal year. Cycle counting cannot guarantee inventory accuracy at a fixed date.|"
368,"If annual physical inventory is mandatory, it is strongly suggested to do cycle counting inventory throughout the year. The cycle counting| can help to identify inventory control problems early on. To be effective, cycle counting must use in conjunction with solid management| policies and procedures.|"
370,"The method for cycle counting inventory goes hand in hand with conducting ad-hoc counts which are initiated by the user when some| sort of discrepancy in item quantity is discovered. An ad-hoc count is a user-initiated count for a specific item and storage location. It can| occur at any time for any item. The ad-hoc count normally results from count discrepancies found during one of the store operations. Ad-| hoc counts are not planned in advance, thus materials to be counted would be manually selected.|"
371,"For conducting a physical inventory, we can use a method like the ABC classification, which also could be the basis for count| frequencies establishment into frame of an automatic cycle count schedule.|"
372,"The ABC classification procedure ranks materials more based on their frequency of use, importance and so on than materials typology.| Thus, ""A"" materials (high volume, high rotation, high importance) are counted very frequently (e.g. once a month), ""B"" materials| (average volume, rotation, and importance) are counted less frequently (e.g. quarterly), and ""C"" materials (low volume, rotation,| importance) are counted once or twice a year.|"
377,"In the HFM reporting package, the Cost of Good Sold must be split between Material, Labour, Development and Other DVC as follows :|"

511,"Contingent assets usually arise from unplanned or other unexpected events that give rise to the possibility of an inflow of economic| benefits to the Group. An example is a claim that the Group is pursuing through legal processes, where the outcome is uncertain.|"
512,"Contingent assets are not recognized in financial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never be| realized. However, when the realization of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a Contingent asset and its recognition| is appropriate.|"
513,"A Contingent asset is disclosed, where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.|"
514,"Contingent assets are assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the financial statements. If it has| become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related income are recognized in the financial| statements of the period in which the change occurs.

519,"The seller in a business combination may contractually indemnify the acquirer for the outcome of the contingency or uncertainty| related to all or part of a specific asset or liability. These usually relate to uncertainties as to the outcome of pre–acquisition| contingencies, e.g., uncertain tax positions, environmental liabilities, or legal matters.

'Virtually certain' is not defined in IAS 37 but it is close to 100% as to make any remaining| uncertainty insignificant. What this means in practice is that each case must be assessed on its own merits and any judgement should| be made in the knowledge that, in any event, it is rarely possible to accurately assess the probability of the outcome of a particular| event. However, to the extent that the inflow of economic benefits is probable (the event is more likely than not to occur), IAS 37| requires disclosure of the Contingent asset .|"
524,"In the context of a potential insurance recovery, determining that there is a valid insurance policy for the incident and a claim will be| settled by the insurer, we require evidence confirming that the insurer will be covering the claim.|"
525,The likelihood of receiving compensation should be assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in| the financial statements. The asset and the related income are recognized in the period in which it is determined that a compensation| will be received.No compensation with the Provision is permitted.|
526,"Insurance proceeds shall be recorded as asset in the balance sheet when ""virtually certain"", meaning that :|"

528,"This assessment extends to the analysis of information available after the end of the reporting period and before the date of approval| of the financial statements. In applying IAS 10 Events after the Reporting Period, an asset is recognised only if the information about| the insurance recovery that becomes available in the subsequent period provides evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the| reporting period and its realization was virtually certain at that time.|"

539,"If the Provision is related to contractual matter under negotiation between the Group and third party, best estimate is based on cost| analysis internally documented and developed by the Group's subject matter experts.|"
540,"In measuring the value of individual risks, the value representing the most probable outcome may always be applied.

550,"The Group sells goods with a warranty under which customers are covered for the cost of repairs of any manufacturing defects that| become apparent within the first six months after purchase. If minor defects were detected in all products sold, repair costs of CU1| million would result. If major defects were detected in all products sold, repair costs of CU4 million would result.

554,The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances shall be taken into account by the Group in| reaching the best estimate of a provision.|
555,"The risk adjustment may increase the amount at which a liability is measured. The Group should take cautious approach in making| judgements under conditions of uncertainty so that income or assets are not overstated, and expenses or liabilities are not understated.| However, uncertainty does not justify the creation of excessive provisions or a deliberate overstatement of liabilities.|"
558,Provisions for customer risks mainly integrate the provisions for losses at completion for some of long-term contracts. Provisions for| expected losses are fully recognized as soon as they are identified. |
560,"The Group may sometimes expect to settle an obligation in a currency other than their functional currency. In such cases, the Provision| would be measured in the currency in which settlement is expected and then discounted using a discount rate appropriate for that| currency. The present value would be translated into functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date at which the Provision is| recognized.|"
561,"If the Provision is considered to be a monetary liability, i.e., it is expected to be paid in a fixed or determinable number of units of| currency,it would thereafter be retranslated at the spot exchange rate at each reporting date.In most cases, exchange differences arising| on provisions will be taken to profit or loss in the period in which they arise.|"

However, no discounting is required for provisions where the cash flows will not be sufficiently far into the future for| discounting to have a material impact.|"
568,"Long-term provisions are not discounted since management is not able to assess when the obligation will be settled (notably for| environmental provision). In case the period can be determined the Group, it does not apply any discounting effect when it is| considered not material (individually below K€ 500). |"
570,The effects of future events that could influence the amount required to settle the obligation may be taken into account in measuring the| value of the corresponding Provision when there is sufficient objective evidence that such future events will occur. Examples of such| future events include the following:|

The amount of the reimbursement may not exceed the amount of the corresponding provision.|"
576,"In the statement of income, the expense of recognizing such a Provision may be netted with the amount of the reimbursement. The| recognition requirements for reimbursements are generally stricter than those for normal receivables or other assets. If there is doubt| concerning the enforceability or collectability of the reimbursement, a capitalization is not permitted.|"
577,"If the Provision which is covered by a reimbursement is discounted, the reimbursement shall also be subject to discounting over the| same remaining term as the associated provision.|"
579,"A Provision may be measured in the full amount at the time when it is first recognized in the statement of financial position i.e., when| the Group has a present obligation for the provision. Basically, this means that the Group is not allowed to defer the recognition of a| Provision over future periods and linearized the provisions. |"
581,"After recognition, a Provision will be re-estimated, used and released over the period up to the eventual determination of a settlement| amount for the obligation.

The provisions are estimated with consideration of historical claim statistics and the| warranty period.| Provisions to cover disputes concerning defective products and recalls of clearly identified products.|
689,"The Group provides warranty to its customers at the time of the sale of the product. Under the terms of the contract for sale the| manufacturer undertakes to make good, by repair or replacement, manufacturing defects that become apparent from the date of sale.| On past experience, it is probable that there will be some claims under the warranties, so a Provision is recognized for the best estimate| of the costs making good under the warranty products sold before the balance sheet date.|"
691,"For transactional sales, the costs linked to the contractual warranty are borne by the entity which has sold the product to the first| outside group customer.|"
692,"The Group assumption is that, for the products sold during a certain year, the probability of defect is linear over the warranty period.|"
693,"As an illustration for a given 18-months warranty, 30% of products sold during year N represent a cost for the same year, 60% for the| following year and 10% the year after, with no impact of seasonality.|"
695,Here is the  link of the template to calculate warranty provision on transactional business .|
699,  Example of Calculation of warranty provisionat the end of Year N:|
707,1.Calculate the percentageof warranty costs related to the sales under warranty for the previous years|
708,"Example in year N, the warranty costs of 357 are related to sales of 165 000 or a ratio of 2.16/1000|"
709,30% x SALES(N) + 60% x SALES(N-1) + 10% x SALES(N-2)= 30%*180 000 + 60%*160 000 + 10%*150 000 = 165 000|
711,2.Determine an average ratio of warranty costs/Sales under warranty (in percentage)|

754,"Warranty provision must be accrued from the start of the project execution and consistently with the evolution of the costs and sales| recognized. Once the project is fully delivered, 100% of sales have been recognized and a warranty Provision has been recognizedto| cover the future expected costs. There are 2 situations:|"
755,1. Project revenue is recognized on POC: Warranty Provision is booked monthly in line with % of cost progress|
756,2. Project revenue is booked at completion: Warranty Provision is realized in the moment of revenue recognition = final billing/TECO|
757,"In case a change order is increasing the project sales amount, the amount of warranty Provision needs to be raised to reach the| planned percentage on sales|"
758,Warranty percentage on sales should be theaverage of warranty costs of the last 3 years per activity (except there is a particular| reason to be higher – i.e. product with higher failure rate than usual). Less is not possible.|
759,"The Provision amount needs to be reviewed on a quarterly basis (March, June, September, and December close) and at each hard| close (May and November). |"
760,Guidelines to calculate provsion for warranty when provision is in Engineered to order Back office (tendering case)|
761,"The Project Warranty costs are forecasted for the first time during the Tendering phase. The warranty amount should cover the| expected costs to deliver of the SE Front Office during the contracted warranty period (design engineering, execution, IG referenced| products, third party purchases…). The initial amount should be clearly identified in the approved tender costing and calculated as a| percentage of sales (CS&Q GRAP reporting of yearly warranty costs vs yearly sales on project activities to be used as reference in| case history not available). If it is too difficult to estimate the warranty costs, the percentage used should be the average of warranty| costs of the last 3 years per project activity. Value and percentage of warranty provision can vary depending on the complexity of the| project.|"
762,"In case of warranty extension, the Front Office shall consider and request the Back Office the ""cost plus"" price of this warranty| extension. The Front Office will have to book the warranty provision related to the extension in their local books. Such warranty| extension shall take effect upon receipt of a written notice issued by the Front Office and duly accepted by the Back Office.|"
763,"Maximum warranty period is 18 months after ex-works delivery, in case of longer extended warranty period, the Front Office must| consult the line of business for approval and decision (refer to directive DirQ_GL10R09). |"

787,The following are examples of measures that qualify as restructuring :|
788,"sale or termination of a line of business| closure of business locations or line production in a country or region| relocation of business or line of production from one country or region to another| structural changes in management structure, for example, eliminating a layer of management| fundamental reorganizations that have a material effect on the nature and focus of the Group's operations| relocation of the Group's headquarters.|"

792,"Reorganizations cover operations which do not have a fundamental impact on the entity's operations and will provide future economic| benefits to the entity, for instance productivity gains or creation of a new asset. The costs related to current reorganizations should be| recognized as operating costs, and broken down by function (DVC, MBC..). These costs should not be reported under the heading «| Other expenses » (P68900 – Other operating expenses). As a result, those costs are part of the entity's performance measurement.|"
796,"a) The Restructuring plan has been announced or started before period-end and has been formally detailed (list of people concerned).| The Group must have raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the Restructuring by starting to implement that| plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it (not directly to individual employee, but in overall to employees or their| representatives). Such an announcement must be sufficiently detailed. The resolution of a Restructuring plan by the management prior| to the reporting date is not sufficient for the recognition of a Restructuring provision. The Restructuring plan must be implemented as| soon as possible and completed within a certain time frame. The Restructuring plan must be of a precision that leaves the Group with| no option to terminate the restructuring measures thus avoiding the Constructive obligation to restructure. Provisions for Restructuring| expenditures are therefore not simply provisions for future costs without an external obligation, because the Group has in effect| undertaken a quasi-public obligation to carry out the Restructuring .|"
797,"b) The Group has prepared a detailed formal Restructuring plan, identifying at least:|"
798,"the business or part of a business concerned| the principal locations affected| the location, function and approximate number of employees who will be compensated for terminating their services| the expenditures that will be undertaken; and| when the plan will be implemented.|"
799,c) Restructuring plan costs can be reliably estimated. This estimate should solely include costs directly entailed by the Restructuring| and that do not concern the ongoing activities of the entity. Costs linked to the Restructuring program itself but that relate to ongoing| activities (example: bonus or training costs related to relocated staff) |
800,Costs that give rise to a Provision need to be charges to P69150 - Restructuring provisions and Balance sheet's counterpart is L36110 –| Restructuring provisions. Provision reversal is also accounted for in P69150 - Restructuring provisions.|
801,Costs that are related to Restructurings and which will provide economic benefits to the Group in the future (i.e. which do not comply| with the provision-recognition criteria) should be charged to P&L as expensed Restructuring costs (P69100 - Restructuring expenses in| HFM).|
807,Restructuring costs:When the Group has prepared a detailed plan for the Restructuring and has either announced or started to| implement the plan before the end of the year the estimation of the Liability includes only direct expenditure arising from the| Restructuring .

865,"They can be identified separately (which is not the case of goodwill, see  Transaction Accounting – Acquisitions  policy); and| The Group has control over the future economic benefits derived from the use of the asset (which could correspond to the| generation of additional revenue or the obtaining of savings).|"

869,"In addition, the Group controls an Intangible asset if it has the power to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying| resources and to restrict the access of others to those benefits. This may for example be evidenced by Group legal rights that are| enforceable in a court of law (such as patents or trademarks) or market and technical knowledge developed internally. Such future| economic benefits may include either:|"
870,Revenue from the sale of products or services; or| Cost savings or other benefits resulting from the use of the Asset by the Group.|

874,Costs that do not meet the definition of an intangible asset|
875,"Certain costs do not meet all criteria and cannot be recognized as intangible assets by the Group, such as:|"
876,"Goodwill, since it cannot be separated from the Group business;| Internally generated brands and customer lists, since the underlying costs cannot be distinguished from the Cost of developing| the business as a whole;| Portfolio of customers or market shares, since there are no legal rights to protect nor other ways to control the relationship with| customers or their loyalty to the Group. However, customer relationships can meet the definition of an Intangible asset in the| context of an business combination since the Group may benefit from future contractual rights at the acquisition date (see| the Transaction Accounting – Acquisitions policy).|"
877,"This is similarly the case for costs related to Research activities, training activities, advertising and promotional activities, relocating or| reorganizing part or all of the Group, start-up activities (establishment costs), opening a new facility or business (pre-opening costs),| commencing new operations or launching new products or processes (pre-operating costs) or to specific management, technical talent| or staff skills. |"

882,The approach providing for the recognition of an Intangible asset is summarized in the following chart:|
884,The Group can acquire intangible assets as part of a standalone transaction of through a business combination.|
886,Intangible assets acquired by the Group through a standalone transaction are measured at their acquisition Cost and primarily| correspond to software.|
887,"The price the Group pays to acquire a separate Intangible asset is assumed to reflect expectations about the probability that the| expected future economic benefits embodied in the Asset will flow to the Group. Therefore, the probability recognition criterion is always| considered to be satisfied in such transaction and the Cost of the Asset can usually be measured reliably when the purchase| consideration is in the form of cash or other monetary assets.|"
888,Costs should be included in the initial measurement of an Intangible asset or expensed based on the following natures:|
890,"Purchase price, including import duties and non-| refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade| discounts and rebates| Any directly attributable Cost of preparing the Asset| for its intended use, such as:| Costs of employee benefits arising directly from| bringing the Asset to its working condition| Professional fees arising directly from bringing the| Asset to its working condition| Costs of testing whether the Asset is functioning| properly.|"
891,"Costs of introducing a new product or service| (including costs of advertising and promotional| activities, such as the Group reference catalogue)| Costs of conducting business in a new location or| with a new class of customer (including costs of| training activities)| Administration and other general overhead costs| Costs incurred while an Asset that is already| capable of operating in the manner intended by| management has yet to be brought into use (such| as costs incurred in using or redeploying an| intangible asset, see guidance of this policy in| accordance with capitalization of the software)| Initial operating losses, such as those incurred| while demand for the asset's output builds up.|"
896,Assets may be acquired by the Group through dedicated government grants. See the Grants policy for further details on the Group| accounting for such transactions. |
898,Intangible assets acquired through a business combination are recognized and measured at their Fair value at the acquisition date to| the extent they meet the recognition criteria and their Cost can be measured reliably.|
899,The following items are examples that usually meet the definition of an Intangible asset in the context of the Group business| combinations:|
901,"Trademarks, trade names and other natures of marks| Internet domain names| Non-competition agreements|"
903,Customer lists| Order or production backlog| Customer contracts and related customer relationships| Non-contractual customer relationships|
905,"Licensing, royalty and standstill agreements| Advertising, construction, management, service or supply contracts| Lease agreements|"
910,"When the Group acquires an in-process Research and Development project (whether separately or through a business combination)| that is recognised as an intangible asset, all costs incurred subsequent to this acquisition are accounted for in accordance with general| requirements regarding Research and Development costs (see the Assets generated internally section below). |"
912,Internally generated intangible assets can serve external third parties through sale and licensing or be developed for internal purposes.| Such assets are usually the outcome of two phases:|
913,"A Researchphase, aiming at gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and during which costs incurred are mandatorily| expensed;| Followed by a Development phase, aiming at applying the Research findings to the Group products, processes, systems or| services, during which costs incurred should be capitalized when meeting all the required criteria.|"
917,Identify whether and when there is an identifiable Asset that will generate expected future economic benefits; and| Determine the Cost of the Asset reliably.|
920,"If the Group cannot distinguish the Research phase from the Development phase for a project, all project costs should be expensed as| incurred. |"
921,"The Group has issued internal methodologies to determine the periods over which costs should be capitalized or expensed, which are| further described below.|"
924,"Activities aimed at obtaining new knowledge;| The search for, evaluation and final selection of, applications of research findings or other knowledge;| The search for alternatives for materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services; and| The formulation, design, evaluation and final selection of possible alternatives for new or improved materials, devices, products,| processes, systems or services.|"
925,The Group expenses all costs related to the research phase of any project since it cannot yet demonstrate that an Intangible asset| exists that will generate probable future economic benefits for the Group.|
928,"The design, construction and testing of pre-production or pre-use prototypes and models;| The design of tools, jigs, moulds and dies involving new technology;| The design, construction and testing of a chosen alternative for new or improved materials, devices, products, processes,| systems or services.|"
929,"As a mandatory practice when generating assets internally, the Group capitalizes all Development costs of a project during the period| over which it can cumulatively demonstrate the six following criteria:|"
930,"The technical feasibility of completing the Intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale| Its intention to complete the Intangible asset and use or sell it;| Its ability to use or sell the Intangible asset ;| How the Intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;| The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the Development and to use or sell the| intangible asset; and| Its ability to measure reliably the costs attributable to the Intangible asset during its development.|"
931,"The key criterion to be demonstrated by the Group usually relates to the generation of future economic benefits through the assessment| of the expected project profitability. The Group performs an analysis of each project with the WebOnyx tool to measure its return on| investment based on indicators such as Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Net Present Value (NPV), risk criterion payback (DRC), Yield| Index (TER), Gross Margin %.|"
932,These indicators are calculated for the first time at the decision to design and are updated at each milestone of the Development| process based on Group consolidated figures. They should also be reassessed whenever there is an indication that a project might be| impaired or material deviation to original assumption. See the  Hardware for sale capitalized R&D  and  Software for sale capitalized R&D| sections of the policy for further details.|
933,"In general, the value of an Intangible asset internally generated by the Group comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to| create, produce and prepare the Asset to be capable of operating it in the manner intended by the Group, such as:|"
934,The Cost of materials and services used or consumed in generating the intangible asset;| The Cost of employee-benefits arising from the generation of the intangible asset;| The fees incurred to register any associated legal right;| The Amortization of patents and licenses used to generate the intangible asset; and|
938,"On the other hand, the following costs must necessarily be expensed within the Group if incurred during the Development phase:|"
939,"Selling, administrative and general overheads costs (offer creation, offer management, offer category management, global| marketing costs…);| Identified inefficiencies and initial operating losses incurred before the Asset achieves the planned performance;| Costs linked to advertising and promotional activities;| Costs of relocating or reorganising part or all of the Group;| Costs associated with the training of staff to operate the asset; and| Any other costs for which the recognition criteria are not met.|"
940,"In addition, evidence of the availability to the Group of the resources needed to complete, use and obtain benefits from a capitalized| Intangible asset may be demonstrated through:|"
941,"The existence of a business plan showing the technical, financial and other resources needed as well as the Group ability to| secure those resources for the project;| The availability of external financing through evidence of a lender's willingness to fund the project, if any; and| Detailed project information demonstrating that the Group costing systems can measure reliably the Cost of generating the| Intangible asset internally (salary and other expenditure incurred, for example costs to secure copyrights or licenses when| developing computer software).|"
942,"Ultimately, the value of an internally generated Intangible asset corresponds to the sum of costs incurred from the date when the| Intangible asset first meets the 6 recognition criteria to be gathered during the Development Phase. Costs expensed by the Group prior| to that date cannot be reinstated and must remain expenses of the period during which they were incurred (including costs of the current| year when incurred during the first semester and the half-year consolidated financial statements of the Group have been published).|"
944,"The Group only capitalizes development costs that relate to ""new offers"" projects on existing markets (H1 and H2) as described in the| Innovations Horizons presentation below:|"
946,"The creation of a fully new offer (solution, product, equipment, service, channel…) to support a business challenge and| generate growth while providing new differentiation, innovation features (on business model, technology or usage) or| productivity; or| The Development of an offer that will substitute to an existing one.|"
947,"As regards new offers being developed for new Markets (H3), they are usually not capitalized by the Group as notably the criterion| related to the future economic benefits of the project is not met. |"
951,"After its initial recognition, any Group Intangible asset shall be carried at its initial Cost less any accumulated depreciation (for intangible| assets with a finite useful life) and impairment losses (for all intangible assets).|"
953,"With respect to depreciation, the Group shall assess the Useful life of an intangible asset, including whether it is finite or indefinite, upon| its initial recognition (and periodically reassess this matter over the Asset life). An Intangible asset has an indefinite Useful life when| there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the Asset is expected to generate net cash-flows for the Group.|"
954,The Group shall consider the following factors when determining the Useful life of an intangible asset:|
955,"The expected usage of the Asset and whether it could be managed efficiently by another management team;| Typical product life cycles for the Asset and public information on the estimate of useful lives for similar assets that are used in a| similar way;| Obsolescence, whether technical, technological, commercial or any other type;| The stability of the industry in which the Asset operates and changes in the market demand for the products or services obtained| from the Asset use;| Expected actions by competitors or potential competitors;| The level of maintenance costs required to obtain the expected future economic benefits from the asset;| The period of control of the Group over the Asset and any legal and similar limitation on the use of the Asset by the Group; and| Whether the Useful life of the Asset is dependent upon the Useful life of other assets controlled by the Group.|"
958,"The Useful life of an Intangible asset with an indefinite Useful life shall be reviewed each year to determine whether events and| circumstances continue to support this assessment. If case they do not anymore, the change from an indefinite to finite Useful life is| accounted for as a change in accounting estimate (see the Changes in accounting policies, estimates and errors policy). |"
960,"The depreciable value of an Intangible asset corresponds to its initial Cost less any residual value, which is assumed to be zero unless| the Group can evidence the Asset will be sold at the end of its Useful life and the price at which it will be sold.|"
961,"The depreciation method used shall reflect the pattern in which the asset-generated future cash-flows are expected to be consumed by| the Group. If that pattern can be measured reliably, the straight-line method shall be used.|"
962,"Within the Group, the Useful life of assets developed internally depends on the main technology developed within the project and its| expected period of use by the Group. As a general reference, the standard Useful life of Group intangible assets developed internally is| as follows:|"
968,"The Useful life of other intangible assets recognized (trademarks, technologies acquired, customer relationships…) is determined on a| case-by-case basis.|"
975,"Trademarks are depreciated according to a depreciation plan determined upon their acquisition, in accordance with their estimated| lifespan. It is usually not longer than 40 years. |"

988,This Group framework to capitalize development projects relies on the Schneider Portfolio Tool PPM (Project Portfolio Management).|
991,The Group Waterfall / PMP framework identifies the following gates to monitor the progress of the R&D projects:|
992,"According to this framework, only costs that have been incurred between the ""Do"" decision and the ""Sell"" decision (or development| phase, which corresponds to subphases C, D and E of the chart) can be capitalized.|"
993,"On the contrary, the costs incurred before the ""Do"" gate and after the ""Sell"" gate are not capitalized by the Group.|"
995,The Group Agile developmentapproach corresponds to a product-centered approach with shortened development cycles compared to| the Waterfall / PMP one. This approach aims at regularly releasing additional developments and ultimately achieving faster| commercialization to early meet new market needs identified.|
996,"Like any other R&D project, projects developed under the Agile framework must be capitalized if the costs incurred during the| development phase meet all six criteria previously presented (see  assets generated internally (for internal use or for sale)  in the General| principles section of the policy).|"
1000,"Asset meets the definition of a qualifying Assetand these costs are incurred between the ""Do"" and ""Sell"" decisions (see the  Asset meets the definition of a qualifying Assetand these costs are incurred between the ""Do"" and ""Sell"" decisions (see the  Borrowing| costs  policy for further details).|"
1003,"When costs incurred on a project exceed the initial budget estimated at the ""Do"" gate by 10% or M€ 2, whichever is the lowest, the| capitalization of the excess costs should be validated as per business unit Chart of Approval after discussion with the Group| Accounting policy department (even if the project remains profitable according to the revised business plan). |"
1004,"Capitalization of costs incurred after the first ""Sell"" gate / ""Wave"" Release|"
1005,"Most costs incurred by the Group after the first ""Sell"" gate / ""Wave"" Release are likely to maintain the future economic benefits| embodied in an R&D Asset rather than meeting the criteria to be recognized as an intangible asset. Therefore, such costs are rarely| capitalized within the Group.|"
1008,"Costs incurred in R&D projects related to Quality Value Engineering (QVE) (Quality, Productivity, Obsolescence) and product| adaptation cannot be capitalized. |"
1011,"In some situations, the development process might be shared between several Group entities or subcontracted partially from one| Group entity to another. In such situation, the capitalization of the project will be performed if the Group entity that will own the| intellectual property is reinvoiced by the other Group entities who performed the development work and will be the one capitalizing the| costs.|"
1012,The mark-up on development costs should never be capitalized and therefore not be included in the hourly rate of the entity| reinvoicing its costs. Such mark-up must be reported in the account P65110 SFC-Research & Anticipation . |

1068,"When some costs relate to different stages above (for example one consulting fees purchase order covers both the design and| theDevelopment phases), a pro rata should be estimated by reference to the underlying activities performed to allocate the amount to| each phase and ultimately capitalize the eligible part incurred during the Development phase.|"

1071,"The development phase starts when the organizational and functional analysis is finalized and ends when the work is officially| approved, with the software project being substantially complete and the system being ready for its intended use by the Group| (including all substantial testing being completed). The official approval of the work is a report signed by all the third parties involved| (software company, customer, consultants) acknowledging that the module(s) operate in the required conditions.|"
1072,"Since the implementation of a software may be performed in phases or by groups of releases/modules, the Group proceeds with| partial work approvals for each phase or group of modules. This approach requires an allocation of project costs to each phase /| module, which can be performed:|"
1073,By allocating direct costs to each phase / module; or| By allocating costs to each phase / module in a way that reflects the economic reality of the project.|
1076,"Usually, software meant for internal use by the Group are purchased from a third party. In most cases, the purchase price is a package| that includes multiple elements (such as training, maintenance fees, data conversion, reengineering and rights to future upgrades and| enhancements).|"
1077,"In such a case, the Group allocates the purchase price among all individual elements included in the contract based on objective| evidence of Fair value of each element, which may not be reflected by their contractual prices. |"
1081,"Costs incurred by a Group subsidiary to obtain licenses;| External direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software (such as costs of third parties| services provided to develop the software during the application development stage, costs incurred to obtain computer software| from third parties, travel expenses incurred by employees in their duties directly associated with the software development);| Group employee costs, including payroll and payroll-related costs (such as the cost of employee benefits) for employees directly| associated with and who devote time to the software development project (for example coding and testing activities during the| application development stage), in proportion of their time spent directly on the project.|"
1082,"Regarding internal costs specifically, they are capitalized by the Group if they meet both the following conditions:|"
1083,They have been subject to a detailed budget which can be used as a reference to control actual costs throughout the| development project;| They fall into the Cost categories listed above that qualify for capitalization.|
1085,"Costs incurred with respect to the upgrade or enhancement of an existing software are capitalized only if they result in new| functionalities being added to the system. In parallel, maintenance costs are expensed.|"
1086,"When it is not possible to differentiate maintenance costs from minor upgrade- and enhancement-related costs, all these costs should| be expensed.|"
1089,"For each module of the software project, depreciation should start as soon as the module is ready for use. This date usually| corresponds to the official approval of work (see the  Accounting application by the Group  in the Recognition and initial measurement| section above).|"
1090,"If the functionality of a module is entirely dependent on the completion of other modules, its depreciation should start when both that| module and the other modules upon which it is functionally dependent are all ready for their intended use.|"
1092,"The useful life of a software depends upon the effects of obsolescence, technology, competition, and other economic factors. This useful| life should reflect the fact that rapid changes may be occurring in the development of software products, software operating systems or| computer hardware and whether management intends to replace any technologically inferior software or hardware.|"

1100,  Upfront payment when no intangible asset is recognized for a SaaS contract|
1101,"When the Group provides for an upfront payment related to a SaaS contract for which no intangible asset has been recognized, this| upfront payment is accounted for as a deferred expense to be recognized in P&L as services are provided. |"
1106,"""Pure Saas"" implementation costs (corresponding to configuration and customisation) are accounted for by the Group depending on the| analysis of the corresponding access costs:|"
1107,"If the Group recognized an intangible asset, implementation costs are capitalized in accordance with the criteria for development| costs (see  assets generated internally (for internal use of for sale ) in the General principles section of the policy);| If the Group identified a ""Pure Saas"" service contract, implementation costs are usually expensed. However:|"
1108,"If customisation costs create additional software code that is distinct from the SaaS and that remains under the control of| the Group, it should recognize an intangible asset;| If the configuration and customisation service and the SaaS access service are under the responsibility of the same| provider and are not distinct (see the  revenue recognition  policy for further information on distinct services), the| implementation costs are accounted for as a deferred expense and recognized in P&L over the SaaS contract duration.|"
1109,The approach to account for configuration and customization costs (C&C) as part of a SaaS contract is summarized in the following| chart:|
1112,"As part of a SaaS project, the Group incurs costs to modify its previously existing on-premises IT applications. These costs correspond| to complex interface requirements that enable the Group applications communicating with the additional SaaS system and require new| code to be written by the Group.|"
1113,"Since this new code provides for substantial improvements giving rise to future savings to the Group, is separately identifiable from the| SaaS system and under the control of the Group (assuming other criteria for the capitalization of Development costs are also met), it| recognizes an intangible asset.|"
1114,"By nature, implementation costs are accounted for in accordance with the following table:|"

1169,"Website costs correspond to expenditure incurred by the Group to develop and operate websites for internal or external access. A| website designed for external access may be used for various purposes such as promoting and advertising the products and services of| a company, provide electronic services and sell products and services. A website designed for internal access may be used to store the| Group policies and customer details or search relevant information.|"
1171,"A website developed internally should be recognized as an Intangible asset when meeting the same 6 criteria that apply to R&D| projects. Similarly, the main criterion pertains to the Group being able to demonstrate that the website will generate probable future| economic benefits through the generation of revenues (including direct revenues by enabling orders to be placed).|"
1172,"On the other hand, all costs incurred by the Group to develop a website that will solely or primarily promote and advertise the Group| products and services must be expensed.|"
1173,The capitalization of website costs depends on the stage of development:|
