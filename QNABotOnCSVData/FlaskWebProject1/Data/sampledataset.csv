Standard covered,"**Standard covered**\n\nProvisions, contingent liabilities, and Contingent assets are covered under IAS 37. This policy prescribes the principles to ensure that appropriate recognition criteria and measurement bases are applied to provisions, contingent liabilities, and Contingent assets and to disclose sufficient information in the notes to enable users to understand their nature, timing and amount."
Scope,"**Scope**\n\nThis policy is applied by the Group in accounting for provisions, contingent liabilities, and Contingent assets , except:\n\nthose resulting from Executory contracts , except where the contract is onerous; and\n\nthose covered by another Standard. Such as, Provision for ""Employee Benefits and Stock Options"" are covered in a specific policy which details this method of calculation of the liability.\n\nThis policy does not apply to financial instruments (including guarantees).\n\nAccruals\n\nAccruals are not in the scope of Provision and contingencies. An accrued liability is an obligation that an entity has assumed, usually in the absence of a confirming document, such as a supplier invoice – however there is no uncertainty in the existence of the obligation and the amount related to that obligation."
General principles,"**General principles**\n\nRecognition\n\nProvision is recognized when all of the following conditions are met:\n\nThe Group has a present obligation, whether legal (by virtue of contract, legislation, or other operation of law) or constructive (business policies, accommodation payments, customary practice in the industry), arising from a past event; and\n\nIt is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and\n\nThe amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\nIf not all these conditions are met, no Provision will be recognized.\n\nIf the loss or Liability is not likely and cannot be reliably estimated, but remains possible, the Group discloses it as a Contingent liability. Provisions are calculated on a case-by-case or statistical basis, and discounted when the impact from discounting is significant."
Recognizing a provision because of a constructive obligation,"**Recognizing a provision because of a constructive obligation**\n\nScenario: Refund's policy – product returns:The Group has a generally known policy of refunding purchases by dissatisfied customers, even though it is under no Legal obligation to do so.\n\nIn these circumstances, the sale of its products gives rise to a Constructive obligation because the Group (through its reputation for providing refunds) has created a valid expectation on the part of customers that a refund will be given if they are dissatisfied with their purchase.\n\nThe chart below provides an overview of the recognition criteria for provisions:"
Present obligation as a result of past obligation,"**Present obligation as a result of past obligation**\n\npresent obligation (i.e., a legal or Constructive obligation present at the reporting date) must generally be an obligation towards external third parties, non-consolidated affiliated entities or to other associated or related entities. Provisions for internal expenses without obligations towards third parties are not permitted.\n\nIn addition, the obligation must have arisen because of a past event, or an event that has occurred prior to or at the reporting date. A past event that leads to a present obligation is called an Obligating event . For an event to be an Obligating event , it is necessary that the Group has no realistic alternative to settling the obligation created by the event.\n\nAn Obligating event is an event that creates a legal or a Constructive obligation that results in the Group having no realistic alternative to settling that obligation.\n\nExamples of Obligating event :\n\nGuarantee.\n\nLetter of intent where the entity committed itself to face up to the difficulties of the subsidiary.\n\nLiability warranty.\n\nFuture operating losses vs onerous contract\n\nProvisions for future operating losses cannot be recognized because they do not exist at the reporting date and therefore do not fulfil the general recognition criteria. Which is different with an Onerous contract situation where at reporting date the Group has committed itself to a certain result and the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.\n\nProbable outflow of resources embodying economic benefits\n\nUnder the probability concept, three distinct cases can be identified:\n\nThe probability of a future outflow of economic benefits is greater than 50% (probable).\n\nRecognition of a provision.\n\nThe probability of a future outflow of economic benefits is less than or exactly equal to 50% (possible).\n\nDisclosure in the notes ( Contingent liability).\n\nThe probability of a future outflow of economic benefits is improbable (remote).\n\nNo recognition on the face of the financial statements and no disclosure in the notes."
Reliable estimate of the provision,"**Reliable estimate of the provision**\n\nAn obligation can be reliably estimated as soon as it is possible to estimate at least a probable value or a range of possible values.\n\nIf the amount of an obligation cannot be estimated reliably, no Provision shall be recognized. In such cases, the obligation in question will be classified as a Contingent liability , which may be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nExcept in extremely rare cases, it is possible to determine a range of possible outcomes and can therefore make an estimate of the obligation that is sufficiently reliable to use in recognizing a provision.\n\nThe mid-point (arithmetic mean) shall be applied as the estimated amount of the provision.\n\nThe following chart illustrates the probability concept:\n\nEstimated liabilities for foreign exchange fluctuations\n\nThese are provisions recorded to cover unrealized foreign exchange losses related to off-balance sheet commitments in foreign currencies (ex: uncovered order book). Unrealized foreign exchange losses represent the difference between the market rate at the commitment date and the rate at the end of the period.\n\nEstimated liabilities for financial risks\n\nIf the provisions for the depreciation of the assets that the Group owns in its subsidiary are not sufficient to make up for what is considered to be the subsidiary's debt capital and if the Group may have to support the losses of its subsidiary, an additional Provision for risks shall be made.\n\nContingent liabilities\n\nThe Group shall not recognize a Contingent liability .\n\nContingent liability is disclosed, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.\n\nThe Group recognizes a Provision when:\n\n1. The Group is jointly and severally liable for an obligation and\n2. an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is probable, except in the extremely rare circumstances where no reliable estimate can be made.\n\nContingent liabilities are assessed continually to determine whether an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits has become probable. If it becomes probable that an outflow of future economic benefits will be required for an item previously dealt with as a Contingent liability, a Provision is recognized in the financial statements of the period in which the change in probability occurs (except in the extremely rare circumstances where no reliable estimate can be made).\n\nContingent Liabilities in business combinations situation\n\nIFRS 3 does not apply the recognition rules of IAS 37. Instead,IFRS 3requires the acquirer to recognize a Liability at its fair value if there is a present obligation arising from a past event that can be reliably measured,even if it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.\n\nIf a Contingent liability only represents a possible obligation arising from a past event, whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non–occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity, no Liability is to be recognized under IFRS 3. No Liability is recognized if the acquisition–date fair value of a Contingent liability cannot be measured reliably."
Contingent assets,"**Contingent assets**\n\nThe Group shall not recognize a Contingent asset.\n\nContingent assets usually arise from unplanned or other unexpected events that give rise to the possibility of an inflow of economic benefits to the Group. An example is a claim that the Group is pursuing through legal processes, where the outcome is uncertain.\n\nContingent assets are not recognized in financial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never be realized. However, when the realization of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a Contingent asset and its recognition is appropriate.\n\nContingent asset is disclosed, where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.\n\nContingent assets are assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the financial statements. If it has become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related income are recognized in the financial statements of the period in which the change occurs. If an inflow of economic benefits has become probable, the Group discloses the Contingent assets .\n\nContingent assets in business combinations situation\n\nThe seller in a business combination may contractually indemnify the acquirer for the outcome of the contingency or uncertainty related to all or part of a specific asset or liability. These usually relate to uncertainties as to the outcome of pre–acquisition contingencies, e.g., uncertain tax positions, environmental liabilities, or legal matters. The amount of the indemnity may be capped or the seller will guarantee that the acquirer's Liability will not exceed a specified amount.\n\nIFRS 3considers that the acquirer has obtained an indemnification asset.\n\nInsurance indemnification\n\nThe recognition of the insurance recovery will only be appropriate when its realization is virtually certain, in which case the insurance recovery is no longer a Contingent asset . 'Virtually certain' is not defined in IAS 37 but it is close to 100% as to make any remaining uncertainty insignificant. What this means in practice is that each case must be assessed on its own merits and any judgement should be made in the knowledge that, in any event, it is rarely possible to accurately assess the probability of the outcome of a particular event. However, to the extent that the inflow of economic benefits is probable (the event is more likely than not to occur), IAS 37 requires disclosure of the Contingent asset .\n\nIn the context of a potential insurance recovery, determining that there is a valid insurance policy for the incident and a claim will be settled by the insurer, we require evidence confirming that the insurer will be covering the claim.\n\nThe likelihood of receiving compensation should be assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the financial statements. The asset and the related income are recognized in the period in which it is determined that a compensation will be received.No compensation with the Provision is permitted.\n\nInsurance proceeds shall be recorded as asset in the balance sheet when ""virtually certain"", meaning that :\n\nthe claim was duly notified to the insurer, the insurer has been managing the claim and has not issued a denial or reservation letter, in case no answer has been received from the Insurer at reporting date, a legal opinion or confirmation of the Insurance Department is necessary to confirm that the Insurance policy will apply.\n\nand the amount to be booked shall not exceed the insurer own valuation of the risk plus a reasonable estimation of defense costs.\n\nThis assessment extends to the analysis of information available after the end of the reporting period and before the date of approval of the financial statements. In applying IAS 10 Events after the Reporting Period, an asset is recognised only if the information about the insurance recovery that becomes available in the subsequent period provides evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period and its realization was virtually certain at that time."
Recognition of an insurance recovery,"**Recognition of an insurance recovery**\n\nAssume Entity A, with a 31 March 20XX year-end, owned property with a net book value of CU100 just before a natural disaster that completely destroys the property in March 20XX. The fair value of the property was CU130 based on an independent appraisal shortly before the natural disaster. Also assume that Entity A's insurance policy provides for compensation for any insured loss based on the fair value of the property.\n\nEntity A would recognise a CU100 loss on the property in the period the natural disaster occurred. A CU130 insurance recovery for the incurred loss would be recognised in the period it is determined that there is no contingency that the insurance entity will settle the claim. If settlement was only probable, the claim would be disclosed, but not recognised.\n\nThe illustration below considers that there is uncertainty in the settlement of the claim and has been simplified in that it assumes the complete destruction of the insured asset. These concepts would also apply to a recognised partial impairment of the insured asset.\n\nMeasurement principles to recognize a provision"
Principle 1: Best estimate,"**Principle 1: Best estimate**\n\nThe best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation is the amount the Group would rationally pay to settle the obligation at the reporting date or to transfer it to a third party at that time. Thus, all risks and uncertainties that have a bearing on the estimate may be considered.\n\nIf the Provision is related to legal dispute and claim, best estimate would be determined after consulting with the Group's legal advisor or internal in-house legal department.\n\nIf the Provision is related to contractual matter under negotiation between the Group and third party, best estimate is based on cost analysis internally documented and developed by the Group's subject matter experts.\n\nIn measuring the value of individual risks, the value representing the most probable outcome may always be applied. The estimates are determined by the judgement of the management based on the experience of similar transactions and sometimes on reports from independent experts. As a basic rule, each Provision shall be measured separately and individually. However, a group of similar obligations may be measured together.\n\nAll the provisions shall be reviewed by the Group at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.\n\nThe estimate of these amount shall be determined by:\n\nReports from independent experts;\n\nJudgement based on past experience in similar transactions ;\n\nLegal dispositions,\n\nStatistical data.\n\nStatistical or lump sum methods, as long as they base the calculation on the historical data are permitted."
Best estimate of provsionamount,"**Best estimate of provsionamount**\n\nIn a legal case there is a 70% probability that the Group has to pay the damages of CU500,000 and a 30% probability that the claim against the Group will be dismissed. The Provision in this case is measured at CU500,000 because this is the most probable outcome."
Calculation of expected value,"**Calculation of expected value**\n\nThe Group sells goods with a warranty under which customers are covered for the cost of repairs of any manufacturing defects that become apparent within the first six months after purchase. If minor defects were detected in all products sold, repair costs of CU1 million would result. If major defects were detected in all products sold, repair costs of CU4 million would result. The Group's past experience and future expectations indicate that, for the coming year, 75% of the goods sold will have no defects, 20% of the goods sold will have minor defects and 5% of the goods sold will have major defects. The Group assesses the probability of a transfer for the warranty obligations as a whole.\n\nThe expected value of the cost of repairs is:\n\n(75% of nil) + (20% of CU1 million) + (5% of CU4 million) = CU400,000.\n\nPrinciple 2: Risks and uncertainties\n\nThe risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances shall be taken into account by the Group in reaching the best estimate of a provision.\n\nThe risk adjustment may increase the amount at which a liability is measured. The Group should take cautious approach in making judgements under conditions of uncertainty so that income or assets are not overstated, and expenses or liabilities are not understated. However, uncertainty does not justify the creation of excessive provisions or a deliberate overstatement of liabilities.\n\nCustomer risks\n\nProvisions for customer risks mainly integrate the provisions for losses at completion for some of long-term contracts. Provisions for expected losses are fully recognized as soon as they are identified.\n\nPrinciple 3: Provisions in foreign currency\n\nThe Group may sometimes expect to settle an obligation in a currency other than their functional currency. In such cases, the Provision would be measured in the currency in which settlement is expected and then discounted using a discount rate appropriate for that currency. The present value would be translated into functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date at which the Provision is recognized.\n\nIf the Provision is considered to be a monetary liability, i.e., it is expected to be paid in a fixed or determinable number of units of currency,it would thereafter be retranslated at the spot exchange rate at each reporting date.In most cases, exchange differences arising on provisions will be taken to profit or loss in the period in which they arise."
Principle 4: Discounting to present value,"**Principle 4: Discounting to present value**\n\nIt is required that where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of a Provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.\n\nThe discount rate to be used in arriving at the present value shall be a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The discount rate shall not reflect risks for which the future cash flow estimates have been adjusted. However, no discounting is required for provisions where the cash flows will not be sufficiently far into the future for discounting to have a material impact."
Discounting,"**Discounting**\n\nLong-term provisions are not discounted since management is not able to assess when the obligation will be settled (notably for environmental provision). In case the period can be determined the Group, it does not apply any discounting effect when it is considered not material (individually below K€ 500).\n\nPrinciple 5: Future events\n\nThe effects of future events that could influence the amount required to settle the obligation may be taken into account in measuring the value of the corresponding Provision when there is sufficient objective evidence that such future events will occur. Examples of such future events include the following:\n\nThe effects of future salary developments, in measuring the value of personnel-related provisions.\n\nThe effects of possible new legislation when it is highly probable that such legislation will be enacted."
Principe 6: Reimbursements,"**Principe 6: Reimbursements**\n\nWhen all or some of the expenditure required to settle a Provision are expected to be reimbursed by another party, such reimbursement may be recognized as an asset only:\n\nWhen it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received.\n\nIf the Group settles the obligation.\n\nExamples of such cases include insurance contracts, indemnity clauses and suppliers' warranties. If the above conditions are met, the reimbursements are to be recognized as separate assets measured at fair value and may not be offset against the obligation in measuring the provision. The amount of the reimbursement may not exceed the amount of the corresponding provision.\n\nIn the statement of income, the expense of recognizing such a Provision may be netted with the amount of the reimbursement. The recognition requirements for reimbursements are generally stricter than those for normal receivables or other assets. If there is doubt concerning the enforceability or collectability of the reimbursement, a capitalization is not permitted.\n\nIf the Provision which is covered by a reimbursement is discounted, the reimbursement shall also be subject to discounting over the same remaining term as the associated provision.\n\nProhibition of pro-rata accumulation of provisions\n\nProvision may be measured in the full amount at the time when it is first recognized in the statement of financial position i.e., when the Group has a present obligation for the provision. Basically, this means that the Group is not allowed to defer the recognition of a Provision over future periods and linearized the provisions.\n\nSubsequent measurement principles to recognize a provision\n\nAfter recognition, a Provision will be re-estimated, used and released over the period up to the eventual determination of a settlement amount for the obligation. It is required that provisions shall be reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.\n\nIf it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the Provision shall be reversed.Where discounting is applied, the carrying amount of a Provision increases in each period to reflect the passage of time. This increase is recognized as a borrowing cost.\n\nProvision shall be used only for expenditures for which the Provision was originally recognized. It is not allowed for provisions to be redesignated or otherwise used for expenditures for which the Provision was not originally recognized.In such circumstances, a new Provision is created, and the amount no longer needed is reversed, as to do otherwise would conceal the impact of two different events."
Litigations,"**Litigations**\n\nlitigation is a dispute with a third party which gives rise to judicial, arbitral, or consensual proceedings and may entail financial consequences that are unfavorable to the Group.\n\nTo determine the risk of an unfavorable outcome and justify its position, it is in the Group's best interests to appeal to the judgement of outside counsellors (lawyers, technical experts, arbitrators, etc.).\n\nLitigations may be fully identified and authenticated by third party claims or actions.\n\nLitigations may be technical, commercial (customers, distributions, etc.), administrative, with suppliers, with employee.\n\nIn any case, provisions for technical litigations do not replace or serve the same purpose as warranty provisions given to customers. The former cover risks that are fully identified and authenticated by customer claims whereas warranty provisions are global in nature.\n\nThe claim file is the basis for the identification and authentication of the risk and the provision.\n\nIt is the essential element for the accounting and fiscal justification of the provision.\n\nThe claim file contains:\n\na technical claim letter from at least one customer.\n\nan itemized cost estimates.\n\ndocuments which justify regular follow-up of the provision.\n\nLegal department involvement\n\nThe Legal Department must be advised of, oversee and control all claims and disputes which will likely give rise to litigation. The Legal Department will provide support to the business & operational staffs for the management of any pre-litigation claims and disputes they may encounter.\n\nThe Legal Department is responsible for the management of all litigations pending before courts (civil or administrative) or in adjudication, mediation or arbitration. Any notices of suit, claim, complaint, or general court notice should be communicated to the Legal Department.\n\nLegal Department assesses the merits of the claim with potential help from or external legal consultants. Legal team checks the information available and coordinates the notification to the insurance company if the case can be covered\n\nIn some cases, the insurer is going to take over the management of the case (nomination of lawyer). In other cases, SE counsel (or external legal consultant) will pursue the evaluation of the merits and the quantum of the case.\n\nBased on the exchange with the third parties & facts gathered, Legal Department is responsible for filling and maintaining the information in Dilitrust (tool used for the management of claims). The tool is updated during the ""life"" of the cases with:\n\nclaims amount (letter or phone call from 3rd party),\n\nthe assessment from legal Department:\n\nrisk assessment (probable, possible or remote)\n\nLow and high estimate\n\nCoverage per insurance\n\nthe Provision as quantified in consultation with local finance\n\nThe assessment is communicated to the local management including local finance that will account for the risk identified as probable by the legal department in Dillitrust and for the amount determined as the most probable.\n\nAs a reminder, potential insurance coverage is not to be accounted for as a reduction of the risk and therefore the Provision booked. The Provision should reflect the gross value of the risk and if the insurance part is considered as virtually certain (link to the proper paragraph), then a separate asset should be accounted for.\n\nWhen the case is closed (settled, final court judgement, case abandoned or case is transferred out of the Group), Legal department communicates the closure of the case to the local management including local finance. As long as the case is determined as closed by legal department and that risks are extinguished, the Provision needs to be written off.\n\nIn term of follow-up, CAOs are accountable for following on a quarterly basis the appropriateness of the provisions in relation to Dillitrust information in relation with the Legal department. Any Provision related to litigation should be supported by information correctly filled in in Dillitrust.\n\nLegal costs\n\nThe valuation a Provision for litigations should include costs payable to third parties, such as the legal costs associated with settling a lawsuit."
Onerous contracts / Customer Risks,**Onerous contracts / Customer Risks**\n\nAn Onerous contract is a contract in which the Group has committed itself to a certain result and the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. This could be the case in long-term project for which we identify loss at completion. A contract on unfavorable terms is not necessarily onerous.
Recognition,"**Recognition**\n\nIf the Group has a contract that is onerous, the present obligation under the contract shall be recognized as a provision.\n\nIf a contract can be cancelled without having to pay compensation to the other party, there is no obligation and therefore no Provision may be recognized. The same applies to contracts that are pending but are not onerous.\n\nThe unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it.\n\nBefore a Provision can be recognized, the Group may first recognize any necessary impairment losses in the assets associated with the contract. The amount of any impairment losses recognized in the assets associated with the contract shall be deducted from the measured value of the provision. If the calculated impairment is lower than the carrying amount of the assets assigned to the Onerous contract , the impairment shall be allocated to these assets in proportion to their carrying amounts.\n\nThe expected benefit under a contract is the net present value of the future inflows related to the contract. Estimating the future benefits to be derived may require judgement, possibly based on past experience or expert advice. In considering the expected benefits under a contract it may be necessary to evaluate the Group's expected use of a product.\n\nUsually, a decision to terminate a contract does not result in a legal or Constructive obligation . Therefore, costs of cancelling or terminating a contract shall not be recognized until the contract actually is terminated, unless the contract becomes onerous."
Measurement,"**Measurement**\n\nThe provisions for unavoidable costs/anticipated losses under Onerous contracts shall be measured in the amount of the present obligation under the contract, the obligation excess which is derived from the difference between the expected economic benefits from the contract and the unavoidable costs. The unavoidable costs represent the least net cost of exiting from the contract. The least net cost is defined as the lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any compensation or penalties arising from the failure to fulfil it. An early termination of a contract can only be considered if it is possible under the terms of the contract.\n\nThe cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract. Costs that relate directly to a contract consist of both:\n\nthe incremental costs of fulfilling that contract—for example, direct labor and materials; and\n\nan allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts—for example, an allocation of the depreciation charge for an item of property, plant and equipment used in fulfilling that contract among others.\n\nIf a contract is for goods, or if the Group recognizes and measures onerous service contracts then only unavoidable costs directly associated with meeting the Group's obligations under the contract shall be considered in determining whether the contract is onerous and in measuring any resulting provision. The unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract are only cost that:\n\nAre directly variable with the contract and therefore incremental to the performance of the contract.\n\nDoes not include allocated or shared costs that will be incurred regardless of whether the Group fulfils the contract or not.\n\nCannot be avoided by the Group's future actions.\n\nThe present value of the obligation under an Onerous contract shall be recognized as a provision. This shall be the lower of the cost of terminating the contract and the net cost of continuing with the contract. Revenues directly related to the contract also shall be considered in measuring the provision.\n\nThe allocation of this anticipated loss between an impairment loss and Onerous contract Provision as well as the lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract and of terminating the contract shall be considered in measuring the provision, regardless of the Group's intention."
Onerous contract,"**Onerous contract**\n\n*The Group operates profitably from a factory that it has leased under operating lease. During December 2022 the Group relocates its operations to a new factory. The lease on the old factory continues for the next 4 years, it cannot be cancelled, and the factory cannot be re-let to another user.The Obligating event is the signing of the lease contract, which gives rise to a Legal obligation and when the lease becomes onerous, an outflow of resources is probable for the Group. As a result, a Provision is recognized for the best estimate of the unavoidable lease payments.\n\nIdentification of Onerous contracts provision\n\nIn order to identify if the booking of a Provision for Onerous contract needs to be booked, the project margin have to be analyzed.\n\nFor Group reporting purposes, CCO margin shall be analyzed. For statutory reporting purpose, statutory margin shall be analyzed in coordination with project controlling.\n\nIf statutory margin is negative and CCO margin is positive, a loss at completion shall be booked only in statutory financial statements and not in HFM reporting package.\n\nIf statutory margin is positive and CCO margin negative, a loss at completion shall be reported in HFM reporting package, but not in statutory financial statements.\n\nThis analysis of the margin is made at performance obligation level (please refer to the IFRS 15 policy for more information) since a contract can encompass several performance obligations: one could have a positive margin, while another have a negative margin, and as such a Provision is recognized.\n\nThe Provision shall be recognized as soon as soon a negative margin is identified, and released as negative margin is recognized. Accounting teams have the ownership on this. The Provision is regularly reevaluated using the latest estimates at completion. As soon as margin becomes positive again, the Provision is also released.\n\nExample\n\nIn a project, costs to date are 400, costs to complete are estimated to be 1000, and revenue at completion is estimated to be 800.\n\n* POC is 40%. Then, Provision for estimated loss should be (1000-800)*60% = 120\n* At this point: a loss of 80 will have effectively been recognized on incurred costs\n * few months after, all things remaining equal, costs to date are 800.\n* POC is 80%. Then, Provision for estimated loss should be (1000-800)*20% = 40\n* At this point: a loss of 160 will have effectively been recognized on incurred costs\n\n=> As contract progresses, the Provision for Onerous contract will decrease as the negative margin is recognized. RCOA accounts\n\nL36315 – Estimated losses on uncompleted contract\n\nL46315 – NC Estimated losses on uncompleted contract\n\nWhen the Group has prepared a detailed plan for the Restructuring and has either announced or started to implement the plan before the end of the year. The estimation of the Liability includes only direct expenditure arising from the Restructuring ."
Environmental risks,"**Environmental risks**\n\nThis refers to provisions set up to cover the expenses to be incurred in relation with environmental commitment, for instance:\n\nto clean up ground that has been contaminated by the Group's operations.\n\nto cover for fines and penalties notified by government authorities.\n\nto ensure the follow-up and maintenance of decontaminated sites.\n\nThese risks may be linked to operational industrial sites, sites sold to third parties or sites on which all activity has ceased.\n\nThis includes:\n\nsome expenditures for removing asbestos such as the costs incurred by the preparation of the site for work, by the removal/treatment work (assets demolished or scraped are impaired), by the work for cleaning up and decontamination\n\nprovisions to cover expenses induced by the application of Schneider Electric environmental policy even in countries with no environmental legislation. For example: a Provision must be recorded to cover the expenses of the cleaning up of the contamination made by an entity in a country with no environmental legislation\n\nThis does not include:\n\nother costs incurred by the removal of asbestos (for example: moving the furniture, renting of premises to continue the business) that should be expensed as incurred. N.B.: Expenditures for asbestos costs cannot be recognized as major repairs.\n\ncosts incurred in ensuring compliance with RoHS directive.\n\nThe environmental provision, corresponding to the best estimate of the costs to be incurred, shall be booked by the entity which bears the environmental risk, hence the entity which owns the land or the building on which an environmental risk is expected to be probable.\n\nIn case of an acquisition, if a Purchase Price Allocation Provision is booked, then environmental risks of the company acquired have to be considered in the calculation of this PPA Provision amount."
Environmental policy – contaminated land,"**Environmental policy – contaminated land**\n\nThe Group operates in a country with no environmental legislation. However, it has a widely published environmental policy in which it undertakes to clean up all contamination that it causes, and it has a record of honoring this published policy. During the period the Group contaminated some lands in this country.\n\nIn these circumstances, the contamination of the land gives rise to a Constructive obligation because the Group (through its published policy and record of honoring it) has created a valid expectation on the part of those affected by it that the Group will clean up the site. A Provision is recognized for the best estimate of the costs of the clean-up."
Please refer to Income tax policy for Direct Tax risk,"**Please refer to Income tax policy for Direct Tax risk**\n\nIndirect Tax risks generally refer to positions taken by the Group that may be challenged by the tax authorities, and which may result in:\n\nAdditional taxes, penalties, or interest.\n\nChanges in the tax basis of assets or liabilities.\n\nIf, in connection with a tax audit that has started at the respective reporting date (past event), it is determined that an additional tax payment will have to be made, a Provision must be recognized in the amount of the estimated additional tax payment, provided that the other recognition criteria are met:\n\nProbable outflow of resources; and\n\nThe reliable estimation of the amount.\n\nIf the exact amount and timing of the additional tax payment can be determined reliably, an accrued tax Liability shall be recognized instead of a provision.\n\nOngoing or completed tax audit:\n\nThe probable consequences of an ongoing or completed tax audit, which has not given rise to a reassessment notice on the date of the closing of financial year or the date of the settlement of accounts, should be examined by the Group.\n\nIf the points brought up by the authorities during the audit and known at the time of settlement of the accounts appear to be wellfounded, the appropriate provisions should be constituted and classified under the heading of ""Provision"".\n\nIf not well founded and therefore the loss is highly uncertain, no information is necessary.\n\nNo tax audit going on:\n\nIf no tax audit is ongoing at the Balance Sheet date, a Provision for reassessment should be recognized only when the Group identifies a fiscal risk on a specific operation. This identification can be the result of:\n\nA memo of a tax expert that demonstrates the operation does not comply with tax regulations;\n\nThe knowledge that the Group has of tax notices to third parties (related or not to the group) for similar operations.\n\nThe valuation of the amount necessary to settle this obligation can be estimated according to the following:\n\npossibilities to contest the reassessment and probability for the entity to get a favorable issue;\n\npayment of tax reassessments by third parties in similar situations;\n\nrecurring tax audits in the past leading to reassessments because of the size of the Group and the number of operations realized."
Product risks / Warranty,"**Product risks / Warranty**\n\nThese provisions comprise of:\n\nStatistical provisions for warranties: The Group funds provisions on a statistical basis for the residual cost of the Group's product warranties not covered by insurance. The provisions are estimated with consideration of historical claim statistics and the warranty period.\n\nProvisions to cover disputes concerning defective products and recalls of clearly identified products.\n\nThe Group provides warranty to its customers at the time of the sale of the product. Under the terms of the contract for sale the manufacturer undertakes to make good, by repair or replacement, manufacturing defects that become apparent from the date of sale. On past experience, it is probable that there will be some claims under the warranties, so a Provision is recognized for the best estimate of the costs making good under the warranty products sold before the balance sheet date."
Group methodology to calculate provision for warranty,"**Group methodology to calculate provision for warranty**\n\nFor transactional sales, the costs linked to the contractual warranty are borne by the entity which has sold the product to the first outside group customer.\n\nThe Group assumption is that, for the products sold during a certain year, the probability of defect is linear over the warranty period.\n\nAs an illustration for a given 18-months warranty, 30% of products sold during year N represent a cost for the same year, 60% for the following year and 10% the year after, with no impact of seasonality.\n\nThese ratios are explained in the chart below:\n\nHere is the [link of the template to calculate warranty provision on transactional business.](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/SharePointOnlineCommunicationSiteTraining/GFR/EQ8xBQ-bc6BMjQd-C_FpiD4BorBG6lyALB0zEJSX4JuKVg?e=yncFPk)"

Guidelines to be followed for warranty provision calculation in projects,"**Guidelines to be followed for warranty provision calculation in projects**\n\nWarranty provision must be accrued from the start of the project execution and consistently with the evolution of the costs and sales recognized. Once the project is fully delivered, 100% of sales have been recognized and a warranty Provision has been recognizedto cover the future expected costs. There are 2 situations:\n\n1. Project revenue is recognized on POC: Warranty Provision is booked monthly in line with % of cost progress\n2. Project revenue is booked at completion: Warranty Provision is realized in the moment of revenue recognition = final billing/TECO\n\nIn case a change order is increasing the project sales amount, the amount of warranty Provision needs to be raised to reach the planned percentage on sales\n\nWarranty percentage on sales should be theaverage of warranty costs of the last 3 years per activity (except there is a particular reason to be higher – i.e. product with higher failure rate than usual). Less is not possible.\n\nThe Provision amount needs to be reviewed on a quarterly basis (March, June, September, and December close) and at each hard close (May and November).\n\nGuidelines to calculate provsion for warranty when provision is in Engineered to order Back office (tendering case)\n\nThe Project Warranty costs are forecasted for the first time during the Tendering phase. The warranty amount should cover the expected costs to deliver of the SE Front Office during the contracted warranty period (design engineering, execution, IG referenced products, third party purchases…). The initial amount should be clearly identified in the approved tender costing and calculated as a percentage of sales (CS&Q GRAP reporting of yearly warranty costs vs yearly sales on project activities to be used as reference in case history not available). If it is too difficult to estimate the warranty costs, the percentage used should be the average of warranty costs of the last 3 years per project activity. Value and percentage of warranty provision can vary depending on the complexity of the project.\n\nIn case of warranty extension, the Front Office shall consider and request the Back Office the ""cost plus"" price of this warranty extension. The Front Office will have to book the warranty provision related to the extension in their local books. Such warranty extension shall take effect upon receipt of a written notice issued by the Front Office and duly accepted by the Back Office.\n\nMaximum warranty period is 18 months after ex-works delivery, in case of longer extended warranty period, the Front Office must consult the line of business for approval and decision (refer to directive DirQ_GL10R09)."
Technical risks,"**Technical risks**\n\ntechnical risk is defined as a repetitive defect in a series of an offer range sold by Schneider Electric, due to a manufacturing process malfunction or a design flaw or repetitive defects in external vendors component, resulting in an impact on country stocks and/or installed base that must be resolved.\n\nScope of technical risk covers product, services, firmware, cybersecurity, equipment, software.\n\nWhen an entity has a legal or constructive present obligation arising from a past event, meaning when it has been validated (by the Line of Business CS&Q leader, as result of the PRB analysis and evaluation) that defects are determined to be technical risk, then if there is a high probability of outflow of reliably estimable ressources, a Provision shall be booked.\n\nProvision for technical risks includes the following costs:\n\nreplacement product costs (the product lines proposed for replacement may be identical or different)\n\ncost of products, parts or sub-assemblies coming out of stock or manufacturing lines for destruction\n\ncost of destroying defective products, parts or sub-assemblies\n\non-site call labor costs (product exchange or repair)\n\nlabor costs for reworking products in stock or in the process of being manufactured\n\nreplacement product shipping costs (including taxes and customs)\n\ntechnician's travel costs (transport and accommodation)\n\ncosts incurred by analyses and appraisals prior to on-site servicing (including costs related to determining liability)\n\nexpenses incurred to implement palliative actions to minimize customer damage (expenses estimated as DVC or purchase price for outside services).\n\nNo other costs should be considered as Technical Risk.\n\nThe Provision amount must be based on most probable outcome based on past experience / statistical data or substantive reports from internal / external experts. Reasonable assumption needs to be used and documented for estimating customer response rates, defection rates.\n\nTo know more about the process implemented at Schneider Electric (how to process a Technical Risk, who are players and what are [their responsibilities in processing technical risks, how to assess and assign costs incurred), please refer to](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/SupportingDocuments/DirQ_GL11R05 Technical Risk Directive.pdf) [Technical Risks Directive](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/SupportingDocuments/DirQ_GL11R05 Technical Risk Directive.pdf)\n\n[DirQ_GL11R05en.](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/SupportingDocuments/DirQ_GL11R05 Technical Risk Directive.pdf)"
Restructuring expenditures,"**Restructuring expenditures**\n\nIn Schneider Electric, the Restructuring Provision is part of a larger Restructuring plan or program. A Restructuring program is a program that is planned and controlled by management and that materially affects the nature and/or the scope of an entity's operations, or the way the operations are conducted. As an illustration of that fact, the non-replacement of one employee will never qualify as a Restructuring program.\n\nSuch Restructuring programs are budgeted at the initial stage and include potentially several types of spends and costs. Some of them will trigger the booking of a Provision when recognition criteria will be met and some of them will trigger accounting of Restructuring costs as expensed as they will provide economic benefits to the Group in the future even if they do not meet the provision-recognition criteria.\n\nAll Restructuring programs need to be documented and approved according to the Chart of Authority. The validation by the Territory Chief Accounting Officer and by the Group Accounting Policy Director (>500 K€) is to be obtained before the inclusion of the program in the Reporting Forecast and should include amount that will trigger a Provision as well as the cost to be incurred without triggering a provision. Proper template should be filled in and the payback should be calculated (around one year and two years for industrial projects) for every program.\n\nEvery Restructuring program needs to be followed carefully along the time to ensure there is no deviation or over evaluation of the program. Any deviation should be discussed and approved by the Territory Chief Accounting Officer and by the Group Accounting Policy Director (>500 K€).\n\nRecognition of restructuring provision\n\nAll restructuring programs need to be documented and approved according to the Chart of Authority. The validation by the Territory Chief Accounting Officer and by the Group Accounting Policy Director (when the cost estimate exceeds K€ 500) must be obtained before the inclusion of the program in the Reporting Forecast and should include both amounts that will trigger a provision and that will be directly expensed. Proper template should be filled in and the payback should be calculated (around one year and two years for industrial projects) for every program.\n\nEveryrestructuringprogram needs to be followed carefully along the time to ensure there is no deviation or over evaluation of the program. Any deviation should be discussed and approved by the Territory Chief Accounting Officer and by the Group Accounting Policy Director (when the cost estimate exceeds K€ 500).\n\nApproval chart:\n\nThe provision for restructuring costs must be recognized only when the general recognition criteria for provisions are met. An additional condition for the recognition of such provisions is the existence of a constructive obligation on the part of the Group to carry out a restructuring program.\n\nThe following are examples of measures that qualify as restructuring :\n\nsale or termination of a line of business\n\nclosure of business locations or line production in a country or region\n\nrelocation of business or line of production from one country or region to another\n\nstructural changes in management structure, for example, eliminating a layer of management\n\nfundamental reorganizations that have a material effect on the nature and focus of the Group's operations\n\nrelocation of the Group's headquarters.\n\nThe following are examples of measures or costs that do not qualify as restructuring :\n\nredundancies backfilled / talent refresh\n\none/few executives severance costs\n\ncosts of recruiting a new director\n\nfixed costs no more covered\n\ngain on assets disposals\n\nchanging office locations\n\nmarketing expenses\n\nreorganization costs.\n\nReorganizations without fundamental impact\n\nReorganizations cover operations which do not have a fundamental impact on the entity's operations and will provide future economic benefits to the entity, for instance productivity gains or creation of a new asset. The costs related to current reorganizations should be recognized as operating costs, and broken down by function (DVC, MBC.). These costs should not be reported under the heading « Other expenses » (P68900 – Other operating expenses). As a result, those costs are part of the entity's performance measurement.\n\nRemind that the following criteria should be met and documented in order to recognize a restructuring provision\n\n1. The Restructuring plan has been announced or started before period-end and has been formally detailed (list of people concerned). The Group must have raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the Restructuring by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it (not directly to individual employee, but in overall to employees or their representatives). Such an announcement must be sufficiently detailed. The resolution of a Restructuring plan by the management prior to the reporting date is not sufficient for the recognition of a Restructuring provision. The Restructuring plan must be implemented as soon as possible and completed within a certain time frame. The Restructuring plan must be of a precision that leaves the Group with no option to terminate the restructuring measures thus avoiding the Constructive obligation to restructure. Provisions for Restructuring expenditures are therefore not simply provisions for future costs without an external obligation, because the Group has in effect undertaken a quasi-public obligation to carry out the Restructuring .\n2. The Group has prepared a detailed formal Restructuring plan, identifying at least:the business or part of a business concerned the principal locations affected the location, function and approximate number of employees who will be compensated for terminating their services the expenditures that will be undertaken; and when the plan will be implemented.\n3. Restructuring plan costs can be reliably estimated. This estimate should solely include costs directly entailed by the Restructuring and that do not concern the ongoing activities of the entity. Costs linked to the Restructuring program itself but that relate to ongoing activities (example: bonus or training costs related to relocated staff)\n\nCosts that give rise to a Provision need to be charges to P69150 - Restructuring provisions and Balance sheet's counterpart is L36110 – Restructuring provisions. Provision reversal is also accounted for in P69150 - Restructuring provisions.\n\nCosts that are related to Restructurings and which will provide economic benefits to the Group in the future (i.e. which do not comply with the provision-recognition criteria) should be charged to P&L as expensed Restructuring costs (P69100 - Restructuring expenses in HFM).\n\nProhibition of pro-rata accumulation of provisions\n\nRestructuring costs:When the Group has prepared a detailed plan for the Restructuring and has either announced or started to implement the plan before the end of the year the estimation of the Liability includes only direct expenditure arising from the Restructuring . The full Restructuring Provision should be accounted for at the time the plan has started and not spread the booking over different fiscal years.\n\nGains on the disposal of assets:Any gain on the expected disposal of assets may not be considered in measuring the value of provisions, even if the expected disposal is closely linked to the event giving rise to the provision. Gains on expected disposals are treated in accordance with the general rules applying to the recognition of assets and booked in the account P66300 – Gain/(loss) on disposal of fixed assets in Other Operating Income & Expenses"
Definition of terms,"**Definition of terms**\n\nThe key terms used in this policy are defined as follows:\n\nExecutory contracts: Contracts under which neither party has performed any of its obligations or both parties have partially performed their obligations to an equal extent.\n\nProvision: A Liability of uncertain timing or amount.\n\nLiability: A present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits.\n\nObligating event: An event that creates a legal or Constructive obligation that results in an entity having no realistic alternative to settling that obligation.\n\nLegal obligation: An obligation that derives from:\n\na contract (through its explicit or implicit terms).\n\nlegislation; or\n\nother operation of law.\n\nConstructive obligation: An obligation that derives from an entity's actions where:\n\nby an established pattern of past practice, published policies or a sufficiently specific current statement, the entity has indicated to other parties that it will accept certain responsibilities; and\n\nas a result, the entity has created a valid expectation on the part of those other parties that it will discharge those responsibilities.\n\nContingent liability: A possible obligation that\n\narises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or\n\na present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because:\n\nit is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or\n\nthe amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n\nContingent asset: A possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.\n\nOnerous contract: A contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs are defined as the lower of the amount required to settle the obligations under the contract or the amount of compensation or contract penalties incurred if those obligations are not settled.\n\nRestructuring: A program that is planned and controlled by management, and materially changes either:\n\nthe scope of a business undertaken by an entity; or\n\nthe manner in which that business is conducted."

Accounting policy,"**Accounting policy**\n\nContent\n\nGroup cash and cash equivalents include cash available for use by the Group. In particular, cash equivalents are held by the Group for the purpose of meeting short?term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes. For an investment to qualify as a cash equivalent, it must be readily convertible to a known amount of cash and be subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. This is the case only when the investment has a short maturity, which is in practice three months or less from the date of acquisition.\n\nCash andcash equivalents are presented net of Group bank overdrafts when it comes to explaining their variation through the Group statement of cash-flows."
Bank borrowings,"**Bank borrowings**\n\nBank borrowings, including bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand, are generally considered to be financing activities. However, in certain countries,[A1]such bank overdrafts form an integral part of cash management, so that they are included in the Group cash and cash equivalents. Such cash management is generally evidenced by the fact that the bank balance often fluctuates from positive to overdrawn.\n\nRecognition and derecognition\n\nCash in banks movement is recorded at the date the cash or transfer is received / paid by the bank. Cash in banks originates at the date on which the bank credits / debits an amount to the Group account, irrespective of the transaction date. If checks or credit transfers are used to make withdrawals from a bank account, the amount shall be recognized / derecognized at the time the check is handed over (or forwarded) or when the credit transfer form is presented to the bank."
Usual natures of cash and cash equivalents within the Group,"**Usual natures of cash and cash equivalents within the Group**\n\nGroup cash and cash equivalents are usually made of:\n\nCash Bank accounts (with a debit or credit balance) Term deposits of three months or less Marketable securities traded on organized markets, which correspond to short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash at maturity. They notably consist of bank deposits, commercial paper, mutual funds and equivalents.\n\nClassification\n\nGroup cash and cash equivalents are classified as current unless they are restricted from being exchanged or used by the Group to settle a liability within the next twelve months. In case such restrictions apply, they must be classified within the Group non-current financial assets."

The discount rate for the contract is 3% so that the depreciation of the Right of Use is K€ (18) per year and financial interests amount to K€ (3) per year (see the Leasespolicy for further details on the accounting for lease contracts).\n\nThe summarized impact of the lease contract on the Group statement of cash-flows is as follows:\n\nProfit of the year\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment\n\nCash-flows from / (used in) operating activities\n\n(21)\n\n18\n\n(3)\n\nDepreciation and financial interests cost of the year\n\nCancellation of the depreciation of the year\n\nIncrease / (decrease) in other financial debt\n\nIncrease / (decrease) in other financial debt\n\nCash-flows from / (used in) financing activities\n\nTotal cash variation of the year for the lease contract\n\n(20)\n\n3\n\n(17)\n\n(20)\n\nCash payment of the lease contract for the year\n\nCancellation of the non-cash financial interests of the year\n\nOperating activities\n\nCash-flows arising from operating activities is a key indicator of the extent to which the Group operations have generated sufficient cashflows to repay loans, maintain the Group operating capability, pay dividends and make new investments without recourse to external sources of financing. They are primarily derived from the Group principal revenue-producing activities, and therefore result from the transactions that impact the Group P&L, such as:\n\nCash receipts from the sale of goods and the rendering of services\n\nCash receipts from royalties, fees, commissions and other revenue\n\nCash payments to suppliers for goods and services\n\nCash payments to and on behalf of employees\n\nCash payments or refunds of income taxes (unless they can be specifically identified with financing and investing activities).\n\nWhen it comes specifically to cash-flows arising from taxes on income, they shall be classified as cash-flows from operating activities unless they can be related to specific financing and investing activities.\n\nThe Group ""Other non-cash adjustments"" includes P&L impacts that did not have an impact on the Group cash-flows, such as the expense related to stock-options granted during the period."
Group specific KPI related to cash,"**Group specific KPI related to cash**\n\nThe Group has defined two main KPI that rely on cash-flow information:\n\nFree Cash-Flow(FCF) =cash-flowsfrom operating activities - CAPEX\n\nwith CAPEX corresponding to ""Net cash used by investment in operating assets"" as presented within Group cash-flows from investing activities.\n\nCash conversion rate= Free Cash Flow /Group Net Profit\n\nInvesting activities\n\nCash-flows arising from investing activities correspond to expenditures made by the Group for resources intended to generate its future income and cash-flows, such as:\n\nCash payments to acquire or develop capitalized R&D and tangible assets;\n\nCash receipts from the sale of tangible assets;\n\nCash payments to take control (acquisition) / cash receipts from the loss of control (sale) of equity or debt instruments of other entities and interests in joint ventures (see also the Attention point below on the [acquisition / sale of](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Cash and cash equivalents.aspxDefinitions) shares);\n\nCash advances and loans made / cash receipts from the repayment of advances and loans made to other parties;\n\nCash payments for / cash receipts from futures contracts, forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts, except when the contracts are held for dealing or trading purposes, or the payments / receipts are classified as financing activities(see the\n\n[Financial assets and liabilities](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Financial instruments.aspx) policy for further details)."
Assets resulting from investing cash-flows,"**Assets resulting from investing cash-flows**\n\nTo be classified in cash-flowsfrom investing activities, corresponding expenditures must result in the recognition of an asset in the Group balance sheet.\n\nIn particular, acquisition costs incurred by the Group with regards to the acquisition of a company or a business do not give rise to the recognition of an asset, hence the corresponding cash-flows must be presented within the operating cash-flows of the Group.\n\nOn the other hand, right of use assets recognized in application of the lease accounting (see the [Leases)](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Leases.aspx) do not give rise to cash-flow [movements and are therefore not presented in the investing cash-flows. See theExampleon thePresentation](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Cash and cash equivalents.aspxRCOA-Accounting policy) [of the cash-flows related](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Cash and cash equivalents.aspxRCOA-Accounting policy)\n\n[to leases in the Group statement of cash-flowsfor](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Cash and cash equivalents.aspxRCOA-Accounting policy) [further information.](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Cash and cash equivalents.aspxRCOA-Accounting policy)"
Cash held by companies acquired or disposed,"**Cash held by companies acquired or disposed**\n\nThe line ""Acquisitions and disposals of businesses"" of the cash-flows from investing activitiesmust be presented net of the cash acquired / disposed of, respectively, at the date of the transaction."
Acquisition / sale of shares,**Acquisition / sale of shares**\n\nCash-flows related to the acquisition / sale of shares are presented in the statement of cash-flows based on the following decision tree:\n\nSee theTransaction [accounting -](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Transaction accounting - Business combination.aspx) Acquisitions;Transaction [accounting](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Transaction accounting - Disposals.aspx) -DisposalsandFinancial assets and liabilities policies for further details on the accounting for each nature of transaction).
Financing activities,"**Financing activities**\n\ncash-flows arising from financing activities usually correspond to the following:\n\nCash proceeds from issuing shares or other equity instruments\n\nCash paid to acquire or received from the disposal of shares arising from transactions with non-controlling interests (see also the Attention point on the [Acquisition / sale of shares](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Cash and cash equivalents.aspxDefinitions) in the investing activities section of the policy)\n\nCash payments to acquire or redeem the Group shares\n\nCash proceeds from issuing debentures, loans, notes, bonds, mortgages and other short-term or long-term borrowings\n\nCash repayments of amounts borrowed\n\nCash payments by a lessee, which reduce lease liabilities."
Effect of discontinued operations,"**Effect of discontinued operations**\n\nCash-flows arising from Group discontinued operations correspond to the operating, investing and financing cash-flow movements that occurred in the Group subsidiaries or businesses that are presented as a discontinued operation at the end of the year, since the date the Group has classified them as discontinued (see theTransaction [accounting -Disposals](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Transaction accounting - Disposals.aspx) policy for further details)."
Cash from discontinued operations,"**Cash from discontinued operations**\n\nIn case you identify a situation where a business may be discontinued, please discuss the analysis with the Group Consolidation team, including the impact of the Group statement of cash-flows.\n\nForeign exchange effect on cash-flows\n\nCash-flows arising from transactions of a Group subsidiary are recorded in the subsidiary functional currency by applying the exchange rate between the subsidiary functional currency and the transaction currency, if different, at the date of the cash-flow movement. Subsequently, the Group subsidiary cash balance accumulated at the end of a period is translated into the Group functional currency, if different, by applying the exchange rate between the subsidiary functional currency and the Group functional currency at that same date. See theForeign [Currency](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Foreign currency transactions.aspx) Transactionpolicy for further details.\n\nConsequently, the effect of exchange rate is a component of the cash and cash equivalents variation over a period, when held or due in a currency that is different from the Group functional currency. It corresponds to the accumulated impact of exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents between the date of each underlying transaction (individually recognized at their transaction date rate) and the end of the period (recognized at the period-end rate)."
Definitions,"**Definitions**\n\nCash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits.\n\nCash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nCash-flows are inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nOperating activities are the principal revenue?producing activities of the entity and other activities that are not investing or financing activities.\n\nInvesting activities are the acquisition and disposal of long?term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents.\n\nFinancing activities are activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the contributed equity and borrowings of the entity."

Scope,"**Scope**\n\nThe accounting guidance presented herein should be applied to all intangible assets, except for intangible assets that are within the scope of another standard:\n\nIntangible assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business (see the [Inventories](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Inventory.aspx) policy);\n\nDeferred tax assets (see the [Income taxes](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Income Taxes.aspx) policy);\n\nLeases (see the [Leases](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Leases.aspx) policy);\n\nAssets arising from employee benefits (see the [Employee Benefits](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Employee Benefits.aspx) policy);\n\nFinancial assets (see the [Financial assets and liabilities](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Financial instruments.aspx) policy);\n\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination (see the [Transaction Accounting – Acquisitions](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Transaction accounting - Business combination.aspx) policy);\n\nInsurance contracts;\n\nNon-current intangible assets classified as held for sale (see theTransaction [Accounting – Divestments](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Transaction accounting - Disposals.aspx) policy);\n\nAssets arising from contracts with customers (see theRevenue [recognition – General principles](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Revenue from contracts with customers vFinale0809.aspx1.2. Group accounting policies-1.2.3. General Principles) policy).\n\nGroup intangible assets in the scope of this policy usually pertain to trademarks, capitalized development projects, technologies / patents, customer relationships and software."
Definition of intangible assets,"**Definition of intangible assets**\n\nIntangible assets recognized by the Group are assets without a physical substance that are characterized by the following criteria:\n\nThey can be identified separately (which is not the case of goodwill, see [Transaction Accounting – Acquisitions](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Transaction accounting - Business combination.aspx) policy); and\n\nThe Group has control over the future economic benefits derived from the use of the asset (which could correspond to the generation of additional revenue or the obtaining of savings).\n\nThese criteria apply to costs initially incurred to acquire or internally generate the asset and those incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service the asset.\n\nTo be identifiable, an Intangible assetshall either:\n\nBe capable of being separated or divided from the Group business and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged regardless of whether the Group intends to do so; or\n\nArise from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the Group or from other rights and obligations.\n\nIn addition, the Group controls an Intangible asset if it has the power to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resources and to restrict the access of others to those benefits. This may for example be evidenced by Group legal rights that are enforceable in a court of law (such as patents or trademarks) or market and technical knowledge developed internally. Such future economic benefits may include either:\n\nRevenue from the sale of products or services; or\n\nCost savings or other benefits resulting from the use of the Asset by the Group.\n\nThe Group shall assess the probability of expected future economic benefits using reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent its best estimate of the set of economic conditions that will exist over the Useful life of the asset.\n\nAs a consequence, the Group recognizes intangible assets derived from:\n\nstandalone transaction (separate acquisition of an intangible asset);\n\nbusiness combination (such as Acquired technologies, Customer relationships or Trademarks); or\n\nInternal Development activities (such as Research & Development activities or Software)."
Costs that do not meet the definition of an intangible asset,"**Costs that do not meet the definition of an intangible asset**\n\nCertain costs do not meet all criteria and cannot be recognized as intangible assets by the Group, such as:\n\nGoodwill, since it cannot be separated from the Group business;\n\nInternally generated brands and customer lists, since the underlying costs cannot be distinguished from the Cost of developing the business as a whole;\n\nPortfolio of customers or market shares, since there are no legal rights to protect nor other ways to control the relationship with customers or their loyalty to the Group. However, customer relationships can meet the definition of an Intangible asset in the context of an business combination since the Group may benefit from future contractual rights at the acquisition date (see\n\ntheTransaction [Accounting –](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Transaction accounting - Business combination.aspx) Acquisitionspolicy).\n\nThis is similarly the case for costs related to Research activities, training activities, advertising and promotional activities, relocating or reorganizing part or all of the Group, start-up activities (establishment costs), opening a new facility or business (pre-opening costs), commencing new operations or launching new products or processes (pre-operating costs) or to specific management, technical talent or staff skills.\n\nIf an intangible Asset will generate economic benefits only in combination with other assets, the Group shall apply the concept of cash-\n\ngenerating unit (see the [Impairment of long-lived assets](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Impairment of assets.aspx) policy).\n\nRecognition and initial measurement\n\nThe approach providing for the recognition of an Intangible asset is summarized in the following chart:\n\nAssets acquired\n\nThe Group can acquire intangible assets as part of a standalone transaction of through a business combination.\n\nIntangible assets acquired in a standalone transaction\n\nIntangible assets acquired by the Group through a standalone transaction are measured at their acquisition Cost and primarily correspond to software.\n\nThe price the Group pays to acquire a separate Intangible asset is assumed to reflect expectations about the probability that the expected future economic benefits embodied in the Asset will flow to the Group. Therefore, the probability recognition criterion is always considered to be satisfied in such transaction and the Cost of the Asset can usually be measured reliably when the purchase consideration is in the form of cash or other monetary assets.\n\nCosts should be included in the initial measurement of an Intangible asset or expensed based on the following natures:\n\nCosts linked to the Asset acquisition\n\nPurchase price, including import duties and nonrefundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates Any directly attributable Cost of preparing the Asset for its intended use, such as: Costs of employee benefits arising directly from bringing the Asset to its working condition Professional fees arising directly from bringing the Asset to its working condition Costs of testing whether the Asset is functioning properly.\n\nCosts to be expensed\n\nCosts of introducing a new product or service (including costs of advertising and promotional activities, such as the Group reference catalogue)\n\nCosts of conducting business in a new location or with a new class of customer (including costs of training activities)\n\nAdministration and other general overhead costs\n\nCosts incurred while an Asset that is already capable of operating in the manner intended by management has yet to be brought into use (such as costs incurred in using or redeploying an intangible asset, see guidance of this policy in accordance with capitalization of the software)\n\nInitial operating losses, such as those incurred while demand for the asset's output builds up.\n\nAcquisition by way of a government grant\n\nAssets may be acquired by the Group through dedicated government grants. See theGrantspolicy for further details on the Group accounting for such transactions.\n\nIntangible assets acquired through a business combination\n\nIntangible assets acquired through a business combination are recognized and measured at their Fair value at the acquisition date to the extent they meet the recognition criteria and their Cost can be measured reliably.\n\nThe following items are examples that usually meet the definition of an Intangible asset in the context of the Group business combinations:\n\nMarketing-related intangible assets\n\nCustomer-related intangible assets\n\nContract-based intangible assets\n\nTechnology-based intangible assets\n\nTrademarks, trade names and other natures of marks\n\nInternet domain names\n\nNon-competition agreements\n\nCustomer lists\n\nOrder or production backlog\n\nCustomer contracts and related customer relationships\n\nNon-contractual customer relationships\n\nLicensing, royalty and standstill agreements\n\nAdvertising, construction, management, service or supply contracts\n\nLease agreements\n\nPatented or unpatented technology\n\nComputer software\n\nDatabases\n\nSee the [Transaction Accounting – Acquisitions](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Transaction accounting - Business combination.aspx) policy for further details.\n\nCosts incurred on an acquired in processresearch and Development project\n\nWhen the Group acquires an in-process Research and Development project (whether separately or through a business combination) that is recognised as an intangible asset, all costs incurred subsequent to this acquisition are accounted for in accordance with general requirements regarding Research and Development costs (see theAssets [generated](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Draft-Schneider-Intangible policy_IAS 38 vFinale.aspx1.2. Group accounting policies-1.2.3. General principles) internallysection below).\n\nAssets generated internally (for internal use or for sale)\n\nInternally generated intangible assets can serve external third parties through sale and licensing or be developed for internal purposes. Such assets are usually the outcome of two phases:\n\nA Researchphase, aiming at gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and during which costs incurred are mandatorily expensed;\n\nFollowed by a Development phase, aiming at applying the Research findings to the Group products, processes, systems or services, during which costs incurred should be capitalized when meeting all the required criteria.\n\nThe assessment of whether an internally generated Intangible asset qualifies for recognition requires judgment, since it may be difficult to:\n\nIdentify whether and when there is an identifiable Asset that will generate expected future economic benefits; and\n\nDetermine the Cost of the Asset reliably.\n\nAbsence of distinction between the research and Development phases\n\nIf the Group cannot distinguish the Research phase from the Development phase for a project, all project costs should be expensed as incurred.\n\nThe Group has issued internal methodologies to determine the periods over which costs should be capitalized or expensed, which are further described below.\n\nResearch phase\n\nresearch phase generally involves the following activities:\n\nActivities aimed at obtaining new knowledge;\n\nThe search for, evaluation and final selection of, applications of research findings or other knowledge;\n\nThe search for alternatives for materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services; and\n\nThe formulation, design, evaluation and final selection of possible alternatives for new or improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services.\n\nThe Group expenses all costs related to the research phase of any project since it cannot yet demonstrate that an Intangible asset exists that will generate probable future economic benefits for the Group.\n\nDevelopment phase\n\nDevelopment phase generally involves the following activities:\n\nThe design, construction and testing of pre-production or pre-use prototypes and models;\n\nThe design of tools, jigs, moulds and dies involving new technology;\n\nThe design, construction and testing of a chosen alternative for new or improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services.\n\nAs a mandatory practice when generating assets internally, the Group capitalizes all Development costs of a project during the period over which it can cumulatively demonstrate the six following criteria:\n\nThe technical feasibility of completing the Intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale\n\nIts intention to complete the Intangible asset and use or sell it;\n\nIts ability to use or sell the Intangible asset ;\n\nHow the Intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;\n\nThe availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the Development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and\n\nIts ability to measure reliably the costs attributable to the Intangible asset during its development.\n\nThe key criterion to be demonstrated by the Group usually relates to the generation of future economic benefits through the assessment of the expected project profitability. The Group performs an analysis of each project with the WebOnyx tool to measure its return on investment based on indicators such as Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Net Present Value (NPV), risk criterion payback (DRC), Yield Index (TER), Gross Margin %.\n\nThese indicators are calculated for the first time at the decision to design and are updated at each milestone of the Development process based on Group consolidated figures. They should also be reassessed whenever there is an indication that a project might be\n\nimpaired or material deviation to original assumption. See the [Hardware for sale capitalized R&D](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Draft-Schneider-Intangible policy_IAS 38 vFinale.aspx1.2.

Group accounting policies-1.2.4. R&D for sale)\n\nsections of the policy for further details.\n\nIn general, the value of an Intangible asset internally generated by the Group comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and prepare the Asset to be capable of operating it in the manner intended by the Group, such as:\n\nThe Cost of materials and services used or consumed in generating the intangible asset;\n\nThe Cost of employee-benefits arising from the generation of the intangible asset;\n\nThe fees incurred to register any associated legal right;\n\nThe Amortization of patents and licenses used to generate the intangible asset; and\n\nThe associated borrowing costs (see the [Borrowing costs](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Borrowing Cost.aspx) policy for further details).\n\nOn the other hand, the following costs must necessarily be expensed within the Group if incurred during the Development phase:\n\nSelling, administrative and general overheads costs (offer creation, offer management, offer category management, global marketing costs…);\n\nIdentified inefficiencies and initial operating losses incurred before the Asset achieves the planned performance;\n\nCosts linked to advertising and promotional activities;\n\nCosts of relocating or reorganising part or all of the Group;\n\nCosts associated with the training of staff to operate the asset; and\n\nAny other costs for which the recognition criteria are not met.\n\nIn addition, evidence of the availability to the Group of the resources needed to complete, use and obtain benefits from a capitalized Intangible asset may be demonstrated through:\n\nThe existence of a business plan showing the technical, financial and other resources needed as well as the Group ability to secure those resources for the project;\n\nThe availability of external financing through evidence of a lender's willingness to fund the project, if any; and\n\nDetailed project information demonstrating that the Group costing systems can measure reliably the Cost of generating the Intangible asset internally (salary and other expenditure incurred, for example costs to secure copyrights or licenses when developing computer software).\n\nUltimately, the value of an internally generated Intangible asset corresponds to the sum of costs incurred from the date when the Intangible asset first meets the 6 recognition criteria to be gathered during the Development Phase. Costs expensed by the Group prior to that date cannot be reinstated and must remain expenses of the period during which they were incurred (including costs of the current year when incurred during the first semester and the half-year consolidated financial statements of the Group have been published)."
Capitalized Development costs,"**Capitalized Development costs**\n\nThe Group only capitalizes development costs that relate to ""new offers"" projects on existing markets (H1 and H2) as described in the Innovations Horizons presentation below:\n\nThe H1 and H2 horizons correspond to:\n\nThe creation of a fully new offer (solution, product, equipment, service, channel…) to support a business challenge and generate growth while providing new differentiation, innovation features (on business model, technology or usage) or productivity; or The Development of an offer that will substitute to an existing one.\n\nAs regards new offers being developed for new Markets (H3), they are usually not capitalized by the Group as notably the criterion related to the future economic benefits of the project is not met.\n\nSubsequent measurement\n\nAfter its initial recognition, any Group Intangible asset shall be carried at its initial Cost less any accumulated depreciation (for intangible assets with a finite useful life) and impairment losses (for all intangible assets).\n\nDetermination of the useful life\n\nWith respect to depreciation, the Group shall assess the Useful life of an intangible asset, including whether it is finite or indefinite, upon its initial recognition (and periodically reassess this matter over the Asset life). An Intangible asset has an indefinite Useful life when there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the Asset is expected to generate net cash-flows for the Group.\n\nThe Group shall consider the following factors when determining the Useful life of an intangible asset:\n\nThe expected usage of the Asset and whether it could be managed efficiently by another management team;\n\nTypical product life cycles for the Asset and public information on the estimate of useful lives for similar assets that are used in a similar way;\n\nObsolescence, whether technical, technological, commercial or any other type;\n\nThe stability of the industry in which the Asset operates and changes in the market demand for the products or services obtained from the Asset use;\n\nExpected actions by competitors or potential competitors;\n\nThe level of maintenance costs required to obtain the expected future economic benefits from the asset;\n\nThe period of control of the Group over the Asset and any legal and similar limitation on the use of the Asset by the Group; and\n\nWhether the Useful life of the Asset is dependent upon the Useful life of other assets controlled by the Group.\n\nReassessment of the Useful life of intangible assets\n\nThe Useful life of an Intangible asset with an indefinite Useful life shall be reviewed each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support this assessment. If case they do not anymore, the change from an indefinite to finite Useful life is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate (see theChanges [in accounting policies, estimates and](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Changes in Accounting Policies, Estimates and Errors.aspx) errorspolicy). \n\nDepreciation\n\nThe depreciable value of an Intangible asset corresponds to its initial Cost less any residual value, which is assumed to be zero unless the Group can evidence the Asset will be sold at the end of its Useful life and the price at which it will be sold.\n\nThe depreciation method used shall reflect the pattern in which the asset-generated future cash-flows are expected to be consumed by the Group. If that pattern can be measured reliably, the straight-line method shall be used.\n\nWithin the Group, the Useful life of assets developed internally depends on the main technology developed within the project and its expected period of use by the Group. As a general reference, the standard Useful life of Group intangible assets developed internally is as follows:\n\nSoftware developed for sale\n\n2-3 years\n\nSoftware developed for internal use\n\nHardware / electronics developed internally\n\n3-5 years\n\n3-5 years\n\nElectrotechnics developed internally\n\n10 years\n\nThe Useful life of other intangible assets recognized (trademarks, technologies acquired, customer relationships…) is determined on a case-by-case basis."
Depreciation period of certain intangible assets,"**Depreciation period of certain intangible assets**\n\nPatents are depreciated over their economic lifespan or the legal right duration, whichever is shorter.\n\nLicenses are depreciated over the corresponding contract duration.\n\nTrademarks are depreciated according to a depreciation plan determined upon their acquisition, in accordance with their estimated lifespan. It is usually not longer than 40 years.\n\nThe useful life of an intangible asset that arises from contractual or other legal rights shall not exceed the period of the contractual or other legal rights but may be shorter depending on the period over which the Group expects to use the asset. As such, the useful life of intangible asset may be influenced by both economic and legal factors.\n\nDepreciation shall begin when the intangible assetis available for use, i.e. when it is in location and condition necessary for it to be capable operating in the manner intended by the Group. For instance, for purchased licenses, trademarks or patents, the depreciation shall start when the legal transaction creating the right has occurred.\n\nAccounting for the depreciation of an intangible asset\n\nThe depreciation charge related to intangible assets shall be recognized in P&L. However, if the Intangible asset is used in producing other assets or in the production process within the Group, the depreciation charge constitutes part of the cost for building the other asset or inventory and must be capitalized accordingly.\n\nImpairment\n\nSee the detailed guidance regarding the impairment of intangible assets in the [impairment of assets](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Impairment of assets.aspx) policy.\n\nDerecognition\n\nIntangible assetthat has been disposed of or from which no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.\n\nThe gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset shall be calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset)."
R&D for sale,**R&D for sale**\n\nThe Group capitalizes R&D for sale based on two different frameworks:\n\nWaterfall / PMP Projects\n\nThis Group framework to capitalize development projects relies on the Schneider Portfolio Tool PPM (Project Portfolio Management).
The Group Waterfall / Project Management Process (PMP),"**The Group Waterfall / Project Management Process (PMP)**\n\nThe Group Waterfall / PMP framework identifies the following gates to monitor the progress of the R&D projects:\n\nAccording to this framework, only costs that have been incurred between the ""Do"" decision and the ""Sell"" decision (or development phase, which corresponds to subphases C, D and E of the chart) can be capitalized.\n\nOn the contrary, the costs incurred before the ""Do"" gate and after the ""Sell"" gate are not capitalized by the Group.\n\nAgile Projects\n\nThe Group Agile developmentapproach corresponds to a product-centered approach with shortened development cycles compared to the Waterfall / PMP one. This approach aims at regularly releasing additional developments and ultimately achieving faster commercialization to early meet new market needs identified.\n\nLike any other R&D project, projects developed under the Agile framework must be capitalized if the costs incurred during the development phase meet all six criteria previously presented (see [assets generated internally (for internal use or for sale)](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Draft-Schneider-Intangible policy_IAS 38 vFinale.aspx1.2. Group accounting policies-1.2.3. General principles) in the General principles section of the policy)."
Hardware,"**Hardware**\n\nAs regards borrowing costs related to the financing of a specific R&D project, they are capitalized in the value of the Asset only if this [Asset meets the definition of a qualifying Assetand these costs are incurred between the ""Do"" and ""Sell"" decisions (see the](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Borrowing Cost.aspx) [Borrowing costs](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Borrowing Cost.aspx) [policy for further details).](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Borrowing Cost.aspx)\n\nOverrun costs on R&D projects\n\nWhen costs incurred on a project exceed the initial budget estimated at the ""Do"" gate by 10% or M€ 2, whichever is the lowest, the capitalization of the excess costs should be validated as per business unit Chart of Approval after discussion with the Group Accounting policy department (even if the project remains profitable according to the revised business plan).\n\nCapitalization of costs incurred after the first ""Sell"" gate / ""Wave"" Release\n\nMost costs incurred by the Group after the first ""Sell"" gate / ""Wave"" Release are likely to maintain the future economic benefits embodied in an R&D Asset rather than meeting the criteria to be recognized as an intangible asset. Therefore, such costs are rarely capitalized within the Group."
Quality Value Engineering (QVE),"**Quality Value Engineering (QVE)**\n\nCosts incurred in R&D projects related to Quality Value Engineering (QVE) (Quality, Productivity, Obsolescence) and product adaptation cannot be capitalized."
Capitalization of projects partially subcontracted,"**Capitalization of projects partially subcontracted**\n\nIn some situations, the development process might be shared between several Group entities or subcontracted partially from one Group entity to another. In such situation, the capitalization of the project will be performed if the Group entity that will own the intellectual property is reinvoiced by the other Group entities who performed the development work and will be the one capitalizing the costs.\n\nThe mark-up on development costs should never be capitalized and therefore not be included in the hourly rate of the entity reinvoicing its costs. Such mark-up must be reported in the accountP65110 SFC-Research & Anticipation. \n\nDepreciation\n\nThe depreciation period of an R&D project starts when the first ""Sell"" gate / ""Wave"" Release (corresponding to the end of the first industrial batch) has been reached."
"Project with several ""Sell"" gates / ""Wave"" Release","**Project with several ""Sell"" gates / ""Wave"" Release**\n\nIn case the product developed through an R&D project is introduced progressively by the Group on different geographical markets, this gives rise to several ""Sell"" gates / ""Wave"" Release for the same project. Consequently, the Group approach is to depreciate the project consistently with the expected revenues to be derived from the project for each geography. Any exception must be validated as per the Group Chart of Authority.\n\nThe Group approach is the same when an R&D project gives rise to several ""Sell"" gates / ""Wave"" Release due to different products being introduced on the market as an outcome of the project.\n\nSee theExamplebelow."
Depreciation of an R&D Asset to be introduced in different geographical markets,"**Depreciation of an R&D Asset to be introduced in different geographical markets**\n\nThe Group has capitalized costs related to an R&D project for M€ 10, with a Useful life of 5 years. The project will be introduced in three different geographies:\n\nEurope (Sell gate in November N) North America (Sell gate in April N+1) Asia (Sell gate in September N+1)\n\nIn addition, based on the financial business case, expected Revenues represent 40% for Europe, 30% for North America and 30% for Asia.\n\nThe depreciation schedule for the project will be as follows:\n\nTotal amount = M€ 10\n\nEurope (40% = M€ 4)\n\nNorth America (30% = M€ 3)\n\nAsia (30% = M€ 3)\n\nN\n\n(134)\n\nN+1\n\n(800)\n\n(450)\n\n(200)\n\nN+2\n\n(800)\n\n(600)\n\n(600)\n\nN+3\n\n(800)\n\n(600)\n\n(600)\n\nN+4\n\n(800)\n\n(600)\n\n(600)\n\nN+5\n\n(666)\n\n(600)\n\n(600)\n\nN+6\n\n(150)\n\n(400)\n\nTotal\n\n4000\n\n3000\n\n3000"
Software,**Software**\n\nCosts incurred by the Group to develop software for sale (for example digitization R&D projects) are accounted for in accordance with the general principles over internally generated intangible assets.

In such projects, hardware is developed using either the Waterfall / PMP or the Agile process and software is developed using the Agile process."
Combination of one/multiplehardware(s)and one/multiple software(s)projects,"**Combination of one/multiplehardware(s)and one/multiple software(s)projects**\n\nSoftware(s)integrated with one or multiple hardware(s)follow the same accounting rationale of the ""pure player"" software described above and shouldnotbe capitalized.\n\nHybrid projects capitalization\n\nNonetheless if the 6 criteria for capitalization are met, IFRS Corporate team must approve thecapitalization decision for the software part of hybrid project developed for sale for which the budget exceeds M€ 2 and all projects capitalization need to be approved as per the local CoA.\n\nAs hardware and software cannot operate on a standalone basis, the 6 criteria required for capitalization of the softwarecannot be met beforethe ""Do"" gate of the hardware project(or its equivalent in the Agile framework). Indeed reaching the ""Do"" gate, or its equivalent in the Agile framework, for the hardware project is highly interrelated withthe software project technical feasability and ability to generate future economic benefits.\n\nHardware related costs should follow the guidelines listed in the dedicated paragraph above."
On premise software accounting (excluding Pure SaaS projects),"**On premise software accounting (excluding Pure SaaS projects)**\n\nThe accounting treatment is ""on premise""if :\n\n* SE has the licence to use the software and the software is installed on SE controlled infrastructure (on premise)\n* ""Hybrid cloud"": software hosted on supplier's cloud but SE has the possibility to install the software on its own infrastructure or has been specifically developped for SE\n\nIf not, the Software is considered as pureSaaS (see next paragraph)."
SaaS solutions and related implementation costs,"**SaaS solutions and related implementation costs**\n\nThis section applies to ""Software as a Service"" (or ""SaaS""), which correspond to a right to access a software installed on a service provider equipment and that is accessible to the Group through the cloud. It does not apply to arrangements in which Schneider sells to customers an access to its own software or equipment.\n\nSaaS access costs\n\nDepending on the way services are provided to the Group under a SaaS contract, it shall recognize:\n\nAn intangible asset, which can be the software itself (if the Group obtains the control of this software in accordance with the criteria of this policy for identifying an intangible asset) or a right of use over the software (see the [Leases](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Leases.aspx) policy for further details on the criteria for identifying a right of use); or\n\nService costs over the duration of the corresponding service contract, when no intangible asset has been identified.\n\nUpfront payment when no intangible asset is recognized for a SaaS contract\n\nWhen the Group provides for an upfront payment related to a SaaS contract for which no intangible asset has been recognized, this upfront payment is accounted for as a deferred expense to be recognized in P&L as services are provided.\n\n""Pure SaaS"" costs andconfiguration/implementation costs\n\nPure Saas costs are expensed\n\n""Pure Saas"" implementation costs (corresponding to configuration and customisation) are accounted for by the Group depending on the analysis of the corresponding access costs:\n\nIf the Group recognized an intangible asset, implementation costs are capitalized in accordance with the criteria for development costs (see [assets generated internally (for internal use of for sale)](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Draft-Schneider-Intangible policy_IAS 38 vFinale.aspx1.2. Group accounting policies-1.2.3. General principles) in the General principles section of the policy);\n\nIf the Group identified a ""Pure Saas"" service contract, implementation costs are usually expensed. However:\n\nIf customisation costs create additional software code that is distinct from the SaaS and that remains under the control of the Group, it should recognize an intangible asset;\n\nIf the configuration and customisation service and the SaaS access service are under the responsibility of the same provider and are not distinct (see the [revenue recognition](https://schneiderelectric.sharepoint.com/sites/GroupAccountingPolicyManual/Policies/Revenue from contracts with customers vFinale0809.aspx) policy for further information on distinct services), the implementation costs are accounted for as a deferred expense and recognized in P&L over the SaaS contract duration.\n\nThe approach to account for configuration and customization costs (C&C) as part of a SaaS contract is summarized in the following chart:"
Capitalization of C&C costs,"**Capitalization of C&C costs**\n\nAs part of a SaaS project, the Group incurs costs to modify its previously existing on-premises IT applications. These costs correspond to complex interface requirements that enable the Group applications communicating with the additional SaaS system and require new code to be written by the Group.\n\nSince this new code provides for substantial improvements giving rise to future savings to the Group, is separately identifiable from the SaaS system and under the control of the Group (assuming other criteria for the capitalization of Development costs are also met), it recognizes an intangible asset.\n\nBy nature, implementation costs are accounted for in accordance with the following table:\n\nNature of implementation costs\n\nConfiguration (software in SaaS mode)\n\nCustomization (modification of the source code for the software in SaaS mode)\n\nCreation of additional code for the SaaS system in the service provider environment (""on cloud"")\n\nModification or add-on (upgrade) to the pre-existing software in the Group environment (""on-premises"") Responsibility for the implementation activities\n\nThe Group or its subcontractor\n\nExpense\n\nExpense\n\nIntangible asset\n\nIf the code is separately identifiable, under the control of the Group and meets thecriteria forDevelopmentcosts capitalization\n\nIntangible asset If the modifications create significant improvement and meet the criteria The SaaS service provider or its subcontractor\n\nExpense\n\n(upfront or over the SaaS contract duration, depending on the existence of distinct services or not)\n\n Expense\n\n(upfront or over the SaaS contract duration, depending on the existence of distinct services or not)\n\n Intangible asset\n\nIf the code is separately identifiable, under the control of the Group and meets thecriteria for Development costs capitalization\n\n Intangible asset If the modifications create significant improvement and meet the criteria for\n\n| | forDevelopmentcosts capitalization | Development costs capitalization |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Data migration | Expense | Expense |\n| User training | Expense | Expense |\n| Evolution of the Group organization and processes | Expense | Expense |"

A website designed for internal access may be used to store the Group policies and customer details or search relevant information.\n\nRecognition\n\nwebsite developed internally should be recognized as an Intangible asset when meeting the same 6 criteria that apply to R&D projects. Similarly, the main criterion pertains to the Group being able to demonstrate that the website will generate probable future economic benefits through the generation of revenues (including direct revenues by enabling orders to be placed).\n\nOn the other hand, all costs incurred by the Group to develop a website that will solely or primarily promote and advertise the Group products and services must be expensed.\n\nThe capitalization of website costs depends on the stage of development:\n\nStage / Nature of costs\n\nPlanning\n\nUndertaking feasibility studies Defining hardware and software specifications Evaluating alternative products and suppliers Selecting preferences\n\nApplication and Infrastructure Development\n\nPurchasing or developing hardware\n\nObtaining a domain name Developing operating software (operating system and server software) Developing code for the application Installing developed applications on the web server\n\nGraphical Design Development\n\nDesigning (layout and color) the web pages Accounting treatment\n\nExpense"
